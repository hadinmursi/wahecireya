One minute they're all anyone can talk about, and then the next, they end up in a <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"What Are They Up To Now?" video or article</a>. Some of these stars had to go back to working regular jobs because they struggled to find work. Others merely stepped away from the spotlight and decided that living an average life was more appealing to them.

It's not uncommon for R&B singers to discover their love of music from church or return to church music after deciding to leave the secular world. In 1973, Al Green became a born-again Christian a year before his former lover poured scalding-hot grits on him and committed suicide due to finding out about his infidelity.</p><p>He already believed that he had strayed from recording righteous music, but this incident drove him to become a minister. While Green is a fully-ordained pastor, he started touring again after a while because he wanted the younger generation to experience his music.</p><h2 id=phoebe-cates-owns-blue-tree-boutique><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Phoebe Cates Owns Blue Tree Boutique</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Phoebe Cates was most known for driving teenage boys crazy in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and gave up on the spotlight to focus on raising a family. Since 1989, she's been married to Oscar-and-three-times-Tony award winner Kevin Kline. She founded Blue Tree in 2005, which is a boutique in New York City. The boutique sells items such as jewelry, clothing, antiques, and perfumes.</p><p>Kline helped come up with the name, which referenced the blue trees in Fauvist paintings. "Blue trees" seem out of place in the forest, and Kate's shop appears out of place in East New York City. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times </a>referred to Blue Tree as "a little oasis" with prices that benefit "ladies who lunch."</p><h2 id=vanilla-ice-works-for-capitol-lighting-in-florida><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Vanilla Ice Works For Capitol Lighting In Florida</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The single Ice Ice Baby was inescapable in the 90s and topped the charts. After a short-lived music career, Vanilla Ice tried his hand in jet skiing and Motocross before being involved in drugs and facing a collapsing career. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanilla Ice also had an appearance on Dancing with the Stars</a>.

Hayes revealed to the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Tribune</a> that he wasn't "Matt Le Blanc" or one of the other cast members from Friends, so doors didn't open, and he was "just another guy".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He tried being a bouncer, but everyone would try to take pictures with him, and they knew he was soft-spoken, so it didn't work out too well. He also tried being a furniture mover, but he was in his 40s, and his back strength wasn't like it was before. It's unclear what Hayes is up to right now, but he is happy that Girlfriends came to Netflix. Hopefully, Netflix cut him a big check.</p><h2 id=jon-gosselin-now-works-at-a-healthcare-facility><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jon Gosselin Now Works At A Healthcare Facility</span></h2><p>Jon Gosselin is the ex-husband of Kate Gosselin.

Technically, he didn't stray that far from being near the industry that made him a star.</p><p>Maronna is best known for his role as Big Pete in Nickelodeon's The Adventures of Pete & Pete. One of his last appearances was his appearance as himself in The Adventures of Pete & Pete 20th Anniversary Reunion.

Former professional boxer George Foreman turned his love for cooking in the kitchen into something truly marketable. He's one of those <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrities known for rebranding themselves</a>. Foreman also made more as an endorser than as a boxer.

Owens also had an Instagram series called Shift Happens that focused on essential workers, which was indeed befitting.

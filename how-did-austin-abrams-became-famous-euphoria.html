As soon as fans saw him pop up as Kat's future boyfriend (then ex-boyfriend) Ethan, it seemed almost destined that his character would be developed significantly. After all, Austin is <a href=#>an actor many recognized from other work</a>, even if they couldn't quite place his name. Unfortunately, Ethan has many more miles to go as a character, but his homoerotic dance in Lexi's play surely kicked his popularity up a notch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney is definitely the breakout star of Euphoria</a>, fans hope that Austin Abrams won't be far behind. But Austin's career has already been pretty impressive, even if fans don't quite know how he first became famous...</p><h2 id=how-did-austin-abrams-get-famous>How Did Austin Abrams Get Famous?</h2><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with NBCLA</a>, Austin Abrams claimed that he doesn't feel his life has changed too much despite being cast in numerous high-profile projects. But he did say that it's "cool" that his work is getting seen by people. Even though Euphoria fans may not know how name (yet), they certainly recognize him from shows like This Is Us (where he plays Marc McKeon), The Walking Dead (AKA Carl's worst enemy, Ron Anderson), and in the short-lived <a href=#>Netflix </a>series Dash & Lily (where he played one of the titular characters).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Austin's acting bug bit him when he was just five years old when he started doing acting summer camps. But it took a few years for Hollywood to pick up on his talents. When the Sarasota, Florida-born actor was a teenager, he was cast in small roles in the TV series The Inbetweeners, Shameless, and Silicon Valley, as well as in Sean Penn's movie Gangster Squad and in the indie hit The Kings Of Summer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Euphoria' Fans' Treatment Of A Woman In Toronto Is An Example Of A Big Hollywood Problem</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, Austin's career was taken to the next level. He was cast in an extremely dark role in The Walking Dead for a nine-episode arc as well as in the coming of age film, Paper Towns. By 2017, he was cast in 4 more movies, including Mike White's flick Brad's Status, in which he played the co-lead with Ben Stiller. Following, Austin was cast in a major role in the horror film Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark, in a couple more Netflix films, and finally as Ethan Lewis in Euphoria.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About 'Euphoria' Star Maude Apatow's Relationship With Her Famous Parents</a></span></p><p>There's no doubt that getting work on such a high-profile HBO show set him up to act opposite Riverdale's Lili Reinhart in Chemical Hearts. The Amazon Prime movie was a hit amongst the film's core audience and cemented Austin as a go-to actor for coming-of-age dramas. After all, he's made A LOT of them. However, the next projects Austin will be tackling are more varied in terms of their genre. Among them is Strangers, co-starring Sophie Turner and Maya Hawke, which is a revenge drama. Then there's the period-piece Mosquito and a university drama called The Line.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-austin-abrams-have-a-girlfriend>Does Austin Abrams Have A Girlfriend?</h2><p>Austin does an exceptional job keeping his private life private, so there's no way to tell if he is dating or not. At the time of this writing, it doesn't appear as though he's in a relationship. Not only do we not know much about his romantic life, but we don't even know anything about his family life.</p><ul><li><strong>Despite fans thinking that he is, Austin Abrams is not related to director J.J. Abrams.</strong></li></ul><p>We do know that both of his parents are doctors and are of Jewish descent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-austin-abrams-have-any-social-media>Does Austin Abrams Have Any Social Media?</h2><p>It appears as though Austin is extremely private. He has basically no public social media presence. This includes Instagram. While there are fan accounts, there doesn't seem to be an official one. This makes him very different from most of his Euphoria co-stars who thrive on of their massive Instagram success. During an interview with Coup De Main, Austin explained that he doesn't understand social media: "In the beginning, I remember having Facebook when I was thirteen and thinking 'What am I gonna say?' I didn't know what to talk about."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This 'Euphoria' Star Was 'Practically Homeless' Before Getting On The Show</a></span></p><p>Perhaps it's a good thing that Austin doesn't have social media, especially after his mostly shirtless sequence in the second to last episode of season two. Fan reactions to NSFW scenes have already taken a toll on a number of the cast of the show, <a href=#>especially Sydney Sweeney</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-austin-abrams-return-for-euphoria-season-3>Will Austin Abrams Return For Euphoria Season 3?</h2><p>At the time of this writing, it does appear as though Austin will return as Ethan in the third season of the show. While he seems grateful for his part in the show, he recently revealed that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> he had concerns about his famous shirtless "I Need A Hero" dance</a> sequence at the end of the penultimate episode of season two. While the dance sequence was as suggestive as 'suggestive' gets, it was originally supposed to be far more so. Austin told Entertainment Weekly that the creator of Euphoria wanted him and all of the other men oiled up for the shirtless scene. Fortunately for him, the creator changed his mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview promoting Paper Towns, Austin claimed that the best piece of advice he could give an up-and-coming actor would be to "do what you feel is right". There's no doubt that Austin has followed his own pearl of wisdom and built an incredible career for himself. One that continues to evolve year by year.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney Is Much More Similar To Her 'Euphoria' Character Than Fans Think</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecCuqq2hnmKuo77ApqpmmpWYrq6xjJ%2BYpqelqHqmwc%2BhpquhkWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-glee-star-heather-morris-amassed-her-4-million-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How 'Glee' Star Heather Morris Amassed Her $4 Million Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heres-how-craig-ferguson-made-his-30-million-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's How Craig Ferguson Made His $30 Million Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

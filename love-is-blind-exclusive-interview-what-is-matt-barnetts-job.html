Viewers of the hit&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Netflix</strong></a> breakout series know the snippet title of his career, "engineer."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But what does that mean beneath the surface, and how did he get to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">where he is today</a>? He exclusively shared that answer and more with&nbsp;TheThings.</p><h2 id=barnett-s-engineer-path>Barnett's Engineer Path</h2><p><strong>On the show, they do specify that you're an engineer. What is it that you do?</strong></p><p>"Right now I'm in construction. I'm in project management for a general contractor. Buildings, high-rises. My degree is actually in environmental engineering, which is an offshoot of civil engineering. Most of my career has been mechanical engineering."</p><p><strong>Was that the dream, that you've always wanted to be an engineer?</strong></p><p>"Not necessarily so. I've always been good at science and math, so that's kind of where it led me to. I think whenever I was in college I started out as biomedical engineering because I was interested in medicine and things like that. But I quickly changed majors my first year."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barnett tried nearly every branch of engineering on the map until he landed on the right route for himself. He stuck with environmental engineering and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Georgia Institute of Technology</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Love Is Blind: Amber Pike And Matt Barnett Are "Doing Amazing" And Want To Have Another Wedding</a></span></p><h2 id=college-life-outside-of-the-library>College Life Outside Of The Library</h2><p>We saw his personality unfold on&nbsp;Love Is Blind, appearing confident and ready to chat it up with the women until he found his potential partner. Barnett outside of Netflix, however, may not have been the partying frat boy that viewers might've pictured.</p><p><strong>You're so outgoing, that's why you and Amber seem to work so well. Were you in a fraternity or were you more of a traditional engineer?</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"In college my freshman year, I joined a fraternity. I pledged a fraternity and I was also playing baseball. (I) quit the fraternity when I got cut from the baseball team."</p><p>His committed relationship whilst in college also made him less of a "Saturday for the Boys" kind of guy, as he described it.</p><p>"I had a long-term girlfriend so I didn't party way too much in college. I was more of a go-home kind of thing," He squinted his eyes towards the Georgia sunlight and concluded, "Ya, I wasn't as much of a partier as I seem to be now."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/barnett-love-is-blind-job.jpg><p>"I never considered myself, I didn't have the 'frat guy' personality in college. I still don't think I do, necessarily. Maybe I do now, I don't know. I kind of put off that vibe now, I feel."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From our Zoom view, he acts more like someone who was a bit caught up in the limelight but leads a normal life filled with the love that he sought in the first place. Production edits can&nbsp;also emphasize quirks. Perhaps one of Barnett's quirks is a sprinkle of frat-ness within his personality.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Love Is Blind's' Amber Gets Nostalgic About Her Trip To Italy With Barnett</a></span></p><h2 id=what-was-his-dating-game>What Was His Dating Game?</h2><p>Furthering the idea that he may have&nbsp;come off the wrong way at times <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while filming&nbsp;Love Is Blind,</a> he&nbsp;explained how he approached dating before meeting and falling for Amber.</p><p><strong>Were you kind of that guy who played girls?</strong></p><p>"I've always been a long-term relationship guy. I've been in three-ish long-term relationships outside of my marriage. They were all about two or three years long each."</p><p>He stated this matter-of-factly, wanting to get the point across that he's stayed close to his morals and how he's valued committed relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>It's funny that you say this because you really do come off differently. That's nice to hear.</strong></p><p>"I mean, there was a lot of alcohol involved in the show. I think that confidence comes from liquid courage, right? It may have helped out a little bit. Between those relationships, I did date around...It was not a long period of time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/barnett-and-amanda.jpg><p>That 'long period of time' being his short spurts of months spent on dating apps.</p><p>Barnett&nbsp;was not exactly going on and on about these past relationships, understandably.

I gave that up a long time ago,” she explained. “I was like, ‘You win. Like, you’re the winner.’”</p><p class=p1>She added, “My ex is a very powerful, famous person, it’s kind of hard to compete on that level.”</p><p class=p1>Moakler — who shares daughter Alabama, 18, and son Landon, 20, with Barker — previously discussed their <a href=#>differing approaches</a> to parenting in an interview she gave to the “Dumb Blonde” podcast.</p><p class=p1>“When Travis got with<strong> Kourtney [Kardashian]</strong>, there was some parental alienation going on there, where Travis — even when we weren’t together — always wanted to be the super dad,” she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1-Shanna-Moakler-Gave-Up-on-Competing-With-Travis-Barkers-Parenting.jpg><p class=p1>The former <i>Playboy</i> model added that Barker and Kardashian, who <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in 2022, offered plenty of exciting trappings for their kids.</p><p class=p1>“When the (Kardashians) first came around, they were enamored, just as, like, young kids would be enamored by them,” Moakler said. “I think there was a lot of glitter and fame and they watched them on TV and now their dad is dating one and they’re going to be on the show. And I think they got caught up in that, which young kids would do.”</p><p class=p1>While appearing on the podcast, Moakler also accused Barker of <a href=#>cheating on her</a> and trolling her online around the time of their 2008 split. She claimed she discovered emails sent to Barker by multiple women while setting up a FaceTime call with their kids on his computer.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“[The other women] didn’t bother as much as when he went to TMZ and he wrote a comment,” she stated. “You write a comment and then [TMZ] will email you a link, and you have to click on the link to approve the comment. And I saw all of these comments in his email that he was posting about me on TMZ about what a s–tty mother I was, what a terrible person I was.”</p><p class=p1>Moakler added that she “couldn’t f–king believe that he was the one behind some of those comments.”</p><p class=p1>Still, Moakler shared with Jeff Lewis that she’s “happy” for Barker, who <a href=#>welcomed his baby</a> Rocky with Kardashian last year.&nbsp; “He’s in a good place, the kids love the new baby, my daughter’s obsessed with him and sends me cute pictures,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasoJGju6J5zKiYpKSVp3qordWeZK6oXaS7bq%2FOpqeerJmjtG7DyK2fZqyilsOqv4ybmKujlafAbrzAq5ynrJmjtHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./skrillex-met-girlfriend-ellie-goulding-over-e-mail-201233.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Skrillex Met Girlfriend Ellie Goulding Over E-mail!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./860395-sasha-banks-on-creating-bank-statement-finisher-working-with-her-husband-in-the-wwe-favorite-moment-of-career-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sasha Banks On Creating Bank Statement Finisher, Working with Her Husband in the WWE, Favorite</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

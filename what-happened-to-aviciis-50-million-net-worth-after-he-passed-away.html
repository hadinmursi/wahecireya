When the artist passed away, he did not have any type of will to leave behind. The artist had a giant net worth of $50 million, though as we're going to reveal in the following, the DJ wasn't motivated by money, and was very giving throughout his career.</p><p>We'll take a closer look at his charitable spending habits, and who got his net worth. In addition, we'll detail his struggles and what went on behind the scenes prior to his passing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Why Elton John Won’t Be Leaving His Kids A Huge Inheritance</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=avicii-wasn-39-t-motivated-by-money-throughout-his-career>Avicii Wasn't Motivated By Money Throughout His Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar49399498.jpg><p>Looking back at his career, <a href=#>Avicii was among the most charitable artists</a>, especially in the world of DJing. The artist learned early on that he didn't need a lot of money in order to feel fulfilled. Given the insane revenue he was bringing in consistently, Avicii gave a lot of to charity during his prime. He revealed that money wasn't a motivator in his life, and he gave back as much as he could.</p><p>He revealed, "I discovered when I started making money that I didn't really need it." The artist made the decision to give back instead, "When you have such an excess of money you don't need, the most sensible, most human and completely obvious thing is to give to people in need."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>9 Wild Ways DJ Khaled Spends His Massive Net Worth</a></span></p><p>After his passing, Avicii's home sold for $17.5 million in the LA area back in 2017. Without a doubt, Avicii would have loved if those profits could've gone to a charity. Instead, the artist didn't make a will, which is understandable given his young age at the time of his passing.</p><h2 id=avicii-did-not-leave-a-will-behind-but-his-net-worth-likely-went-to-his-parents>Avicii Did Not Leave A Will Behind, But His Net Worth Likely Went To His Parents</h2><p>Given that Avicii didn't have a will, who got his fortune? According to Forbes, the laws in Sweden suggest that the artist's parents would be the ones to take over his net worth. The publication explains, "His assets pass to his parents. The intestate laws of Sweden do not include siblings (because his parents are alive) or charities, even though Avicii may have wanted to include them."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar49399527.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The report by Forbes also suggests that his parents had to pay less in taxes from the will, though it would've been a different story had Avicii been born in the United States.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Will Tina Turner's Four Children Inherit Her $250 Million Fortune?</a></span></p><p>The artist passed away at the age of 28, and he was at the prime of his career. Without a doubt, the DJ would still be on top of his game today. Sadly, he had many struggles behind the scenes that started at a young age according to his father.</p><h2 id=avicii-detailed-his-struggled-in-a-journal-while-his-dad-almost-revealed-that-issues-took-place-at-a-young-age>Avicii Detailed His Struggled In A Journal, While His Dad Almost Revealed That Issues Took Place At A Young Age</h2><p>From the outside looking in, it would appear as though the DJ had it all. However, that was not the case as he suffered from lots of anxiety. Avicii opened up about the struggles in his journals. He was particularly struggling during his time on the road.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It feels like I’m going to faint every single day now. And not just today and this tour but from about the first time I mentioned that I felt worn-out. Pretty regularly but I push it back down and choose not to bring it up because there’s nothing I can do about it,” he told his manager.</p><p>He added in his journal, “Of course, I didn’t listen to the majority of doctors. I listened to the couple who said it would be okay if I was careful. I was ignorant and naive and touring the world, still on the never-ending tour because once you’ve circled it once, guess what? You start right back over again.”</p><p>His father Klas also told CBS News that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his son's issues started at a young age as a teen</a>.</p><p>"When you have a child that's not feeling well, you try everything to get the situation right again. And you try to understand what's going on. So, we went to a psychiatrist. I think he was 14 or 15, yeah. And he sort of calmed Tim down."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time of his son's passing, Klas felt as though things were getting better just prior. "The suicide came as a shock to all of us. And we thought that he was really on a better way before."</p><p>The world lost a talented artist but more importantly, a genuine soul.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq3VopqioaNignF5zKKjpaGfo3qvsdNmrqiqpJ16orLTnqlmoJVivaK%2F0p6bZpmnlsZw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-elias-theodorou-how-did-elias-theodorou-die.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened To Elias Theodorou?

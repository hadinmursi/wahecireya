But none of them were more successful than Bring It On. The 2000 teen drama film kicked off <a href=#>a film franchise that led to five more follow-up movies</a>. If anyone asks fans, however, they’re often quick to say that nothing beats the original. After all, Kirsten Dunst and Gabrielle Union’s moves on the dance floor were spot on. Not to mention, the women were accompanied by an incredible supporting cast.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Bring It On Came Out 20 Years Ago. Here Are Some Things You Probably Didn't Know</a></span>These include <a href=#>Jesse Bradford who played Dunst’s love interest Cliff </a>and Eliza Dushku who played Dunst’s best friend Missy. And then, among the other cheerleaders, there’s Bianca Kajlich who played Carver, the cheerleader who breaks her leg after attempting to “cradle out.” Just like Dunst and Union, Kajlich never returned for any of the Bring It On follow-up films. And that may be because the actress got quite busy too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=after-lsquo-bring-it-on-rsquo-bianca-kajlich-rsquo-s-next-film-was-a-horror-slasher>After ‘Bring It On’, Bianca Kajlich’s Next Film Was A Horror Slasher</h2><p>Shortly after playing a cheerleader, Kajlich went on to play Haddonfield University Sara Moyer in the slasher film Halloween: Resurrection. The film marked the actress’ first-ever lead role, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">making her casting extra special</a>.</p><p>“It was my first lead role in a film, and it certainly felt special to be a part of a franchise that has such a crazy legacy,” the actress told Broke Horror Fan.</p><p>“To be able to be in one where Jamie Lee [Curtis] not only came back, but she died in. It’s also a toss-up with horror movies, especially when you’re getting into the higher digits of sequels. I think I was so excited to be a part of a film where I had a really great part and got to be with some really fun actors and actresses and go on location - it was all big time for me, as far as I was concerned.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, Halloween: Resurrection was poorly rated by critics and audiences alike. Nonetheless, Kajlich continues to look back on the film with fondness. “I certainly had a great time making it,” the actress said. “And it’s fun to see something that was one of the first things that I ever did where I really had a lot of responsibility.”</p><h2 id=later-on-bianca-kajlich-ventured-into-horror-again>Later On, Bianca Kajlich Ventured Into Horror Again</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bianca-Kajlich-in-Dark-Was-the-Night-via-IMDb.jpg><p>Years after starring in Hollywood: Resurrection, Kajlich was convinced that it was time to give horror another shot. This time, she took on a role in the horror-thriller Dark Was the Night. And it turns out, the actress landed the role unexpectedly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Have Mixed Feelings About ‘Bring It On’ Getting A Horror Movie Spin-Off</a></span></p><p>“I think somebody fell out at the last minute because they called me and my manager said, ‘You’ve been offered this movie. I don’t really know anything about it. You would have to be there in four days,’” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actress recalled during an interview with Wicked Horror</a>.</p><p>“And they sent the script over and I read it and I called my manager and I was like, ‘I can’t believe I’m just getting to show up for this role. This is a role that I would usually have to audition for and fight for.’ I couldn’t believe my good luck that this thing just kind of showed up on my doorstep.”</p><h2 id=bianca-kajlich-became-a-successful-tv-star>Bianca Kajlich Became A Successful TV Star</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Bring It On, Kajlich went on to book various television roles. For starters, she got cast as Lisa Grier in David E. Kelley’s Emmy-winning drama Boston Public. And even though the show only ran for one season, working on a show gave Kajlich an important realization.</p><p>“I always felt so supported and cared for there,” the actress told PC Principle. “That was my first legitimate gig in television and I would really love to get back to drama at some point because I really enjoyed doing that!”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Recent Photos Of The Cast Of Bring It On</a></span></p><p>Kajlich did do another drama after Boston Public, this time joining the cast of the hit teen drama Dawson’s Creek as recurring character Natasha Kelly. She later starred in lesser-known dramas Vanished and Rock Me, Baby (which is a dramedy) before deciding it was time to pivot to comedy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, the actress got cast in the popular series Rules of Engagement, reuniting her with former Dawson’s Creek co-star Oliver Hudson. And shortly after the show ended, Kajlich went on to star in the comedy Undateable.</p><p>The cast boasts of stand-up comedians such as Brent Morin, Chris D'Elia, Rick Glassman, and Ron Funches. Admittedly, Kajlich struggled to keep up with them at first. “At the beginning, when I first came in, I was trying to keep up with them, and you just can’t; it’s an unstoppable runaway train,” she explained.</p><p>“They are all fantastic and all so talented, and it actually makes me feel real bad about myself sometimes. It’s really cool to be in scenes with them and just watch the magic happen because it’s pretty incredible what they are able to do in the moment.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More recently, Kajlich also landed a role in The CW series Legacies. The actress was introduced as recurring character Sheriff Machado during the show’s second season. Meanwhile, Kajlich doesn’t appear to have any future projects lined up beyond Legacies. That said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it also remains unclear if The CW series will be renewed for a fifth season</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, <a href=#>there’s also been talk about doing a sequel to the original Bring It On </a>in recent years. Both Union and Dunst have even expressed interest in reprising their roles. Perhaps, Kajlich’s Carver will return too.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's What Gabrielle Union's Been Up To Since Bring It On</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZius8LEq2Sfqp%2BieqO%2ByKeeZqGkYryvew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-israel-adesanya-girlfriend-lottie-powdrell-relationship-dating-life-343636-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Israel Adesanya Girlfriend Lottie Powdrell?

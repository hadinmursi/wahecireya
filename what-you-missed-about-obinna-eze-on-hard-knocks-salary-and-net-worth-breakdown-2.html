He was mentioned in the 2021 NFL combine & 2021 Honorable mention big 12 offensive Newcomer of the year. Since then, there has been a tremendous spike in his popularity, and fans are eager to know about his details, including his wife, family and net worth.</p><p>All 14 of the Tigers’ games were started by Obinna Eze at left tackle, and he led Memphis to its first outright American Athletic Conference title and Cotton Bowl berth. To end his collegiate career, Obinna started all 12 games at left tackle, giving him 37 consecutive starts. As a junior, he also started all 11 games at left tackle.</p><p>Recently, Obinna Eze, along with his team members, was featured in an episode of HBO’s docuseries, Hard Knocks, where the players’ hard work and skills were documented. On Tuesday’s episode, offensive lineman Obinna Eze and a half-dozen other athletes who had recently been highlighted were followed. Before the cuts started, Lions coach Dan Campbell explained why those two days were his least favourite of the year.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-obinna-ezes-wife></span>Who Is Obinna Eze’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Obinna is a married man who is married to his wife, Yasmeen Eze. He dated his spouse for two years before they were married on May 30, 2021. They began dating on March 16 of this year and are now married and residing in Fort Worth, Texas. He appears in very minimal interviews, so no one has to succeed in digging up additional information about the NFL player.</p><p>He began playing professional American football in 2015 but only debuted as a professional player in 2017. With only six games throughout his first two years in college, Eze didn’t get much playing time.</p><p>With 14 starts as a left tackle, the huge kit became one of the Tigers’ best lines in 2019. Eze also started the Tigers’ 11 games during the 2020 campaign. That season, the Tigers amassed 6,791 offensive yards while winning the American Athletic Conference title and competing in the Cotton Bowl.</p><p>Eze, a recruit from the 2017 class, was tabbed as a four-star prospect and the nation’s No. 21 offensive lineman prospect by the 247Sports composite rankings. He was classified as the 206th-best player in the country overall.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=obinna-ezes-salary-and-net-worth-in-2022></span>Obinna Eze’s Salary And Net Worth In 2022<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Obinna Eze is estimated to be worth $500,000 overall. According to&nbsp;reports, he makes $150,000 as an offensive lineman for the Detroit Lions. Nigerian-born Eze first moved to the United States to play basketball after catching the attention of American high schools while competing on a Nigerian AAU squad.</p><p>When Obinna Eze was a high school athlete for a Nigerian AAU team, he attracted attention for the first time. He was a reserve player for the Tigers in 2018 and a left tackle in 2019 and 2020. He agreed to the Detroit Lions in May 2022 under an undrafted free agent deal that included a $20,000 signing bonus and a $150,000 basic salary.</p><p>He was considered one of the top tackle prospects in the country despite playing varsity football as a senior at Nashville’s Davidson Academy and selecting Memphis over other prestigious schools like Alabama.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=obinna-eze-was-featured-in-an-episode-of-hard-knocks></span>Obinna Eze Was Featured In An Episode Of Hard Knocks<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eze was featured in the latest episode of HBO’s documentary, Hard Knocks, where he revealed some of the secrets of his former and current team. One shocking statement was that he didn’t regret choosing the Tigers over other offers when he was a four-star recruit in 2017. This particular statement shocked many players, including his fellow rookie Aidan Hutchinson.</p><p>Eze is a skilled player with strong genetics that have abled him to have exceptional power compared to other players on the pitch. He has a wingspan to locate opponents before they find him and a thinner lower body.</p><p>Eze has a lesser floor but a swing tackle potential. He will probably have pad-level concerns, so he has to strengthen his base and get stronger at playing with his hands. He is a contender for a practice squad draft-and-stash run to focus on his weak points.</p><p>The athlete had a great time on the show and believed he had a chance to learn many new things with such good interaction with other players. The other athletes featured in the program were wide receiver Kalil Pimpleton, quarterback David Blough, defensive back Chase Lucas, running back Craig Reynolds, and linebacker Malcolm Rodriguez.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=obinna-ezes-family-life></span>Obinna Eze’s family Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Obinna Eze is an offensive lineman for the Detroit Lions. His parents were from Nigeria when Obinna Eze was born. Chuma Eze and Ifeoma Eze reared him with much love and cared in Nigeria.</p><p>To pursue a career in football, he relocated to the United States and left Nigeria. He was born on July 12, 1998, and is 24 years old. In Nigeria, Obinna has four siblings; Tuvia, Sandra, Stephanie, and Precious.</p><p>He is a citizen of both the United States and Nigeria because he now resides there and is from Nigeria. Obinna is a Christian and a member of the Nigerian ethnic group.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYlsFuxc6uZKaho6iypXnAm6aurF2kr6q6zZpknrKVYryveceaqZ1lm6O8pLfSZqqapJGnxm6tzZ1kp52kYsSwvtOhZJuqlZa4pbvWp2RrZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-dick-wolf-find-net-worth-quote-awards-fact-wiki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Dick Wolf?

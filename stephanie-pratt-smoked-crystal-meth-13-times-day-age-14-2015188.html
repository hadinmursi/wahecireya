The 29-year-old Made in Chelsea star got candid about her troubled childhood, revealing that she struggled with crystal meth addiction at an early age.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was 14 or 15 [when I first smoked it],” she wrote in her book (via the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>). “I was on the extreme level and addiction developed instantly. [I smoked] probably four times before school, then at snack… probably 12 or 13 times a day.”&nbsp;</p><p>The younger sister of notorious reality TV villain <strong>Spencer Pratt </strong>struggled with addiction to both meth and cocaine throughout her childhood, noting her parents turned their heads to her issues.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I didn’t care about anything. I could live or die, I didn’t care,” she said. “I had nothing to get out of bed for, nothing was exciting.”</p><p>In 2006, Pratt was arrested for attempting to steal $4,000 worth of designer clothes while on drugs.&nbsp;</p><p>“I woke up handcuffed to a hospital bed. When I landed back in L.A., Mom took me back home and I went upstairs to my old bedroom and I felt so much shame,” she recalled.&nbsp;</p><p>Things turned around when she joined the cast of The Hills in 2007. Stephanie worked hard to stay sober, despite the party environment portrayed on the reality series.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>But her addiction to drugs morphed into insecurities about her weight as she was surrounded by her stick-thin costars. She became bulimic during her three years on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>“I lost about six pounds in two weeks but bulimia made my face very puffy so I freaked out and began going on crazy little diets, like I’d only eat Tic Tacs,” Stephanie wrote. By 2009 she weighed 105 pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, Stephanie recovered and now leads a clean and healthy life. Her debut memoir, Made in Reality, was released on Aug. 13.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJWltaK6yJ5kqaqRqcFuv8yoop6cXZi%2Fur%2FTmqNmpZWptW59kmaroqWVqHqlrdhmmKCdXWaBbn6PamxqcGhk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./royal-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Royals - Us Weekly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sharon-van-etten-on-her-new-album-tramp-recording-while-homeless-and-the-musical-appeal-of-grunting-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sharon Van Etten on Her New Album Tramp, Recording While Homeless, and the Musical Appeal of Gruntin</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

She was found dead at her home in Paris, BFM Television first announced and President Emmanuel Macron then confirmed in a <a href=#>tweet</a>. “Because she embodied freedom, because she sang the most beautiful words in our language, Jane Birkin was a French icon,” Macron wrote. Birkin had suffered a mild stroke in 2021, but the official cause of death has not been announced. She was 76.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk5nhjhg001f3b6t0s7cfbbc@published data-word-count=124>Birkin first found prominence following her move to Paris from her native London when she was 20. She <a href=#>met the artist Serge Gainsbourg</a> on the set of the 1968 film Slogan, and their subsequent collaborations rocketed the couple to fame. Birkin and Gainsbourg’s tumultuous relationship was the subject of international fascination. Their sexually explicit duet, “Je t’aime … moi non plus,” was condemned by the Vatican and banned in several countries. They would go on to have a daughter together, the singer, actor, and director <a href=#>Charlotte Gainsbourg</a>. Though they broke up in 1981, they would remain friends until Gainsbourg’s death on 1991. Birkin also had two other daughters, Kate Barry and Lou Doillon, from her relationships with composer <a href=#>John Barry</a> and director Jacques Dillon.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk5nr0xw001l3b6tf8v9f616@published data-word-count=130>Birkin, <a href=#>an “It” girl</a> of the 1970s, was a fashion icon who inspired the <a href=#>highly sought-after Birkin bag by Hermès</a>. According to Birkin, the bag was conceived after a flight in which Birkin was seated next to Hermès executive Jean-Louis Dumas. Items were spilling out of her Hermès Kelly bag, which prompted Birkin to suggest that Dumas design a bag four times the size of the Kelly. The Birkin bag, which debuted in 1984, became one of the world’s most coveted accessories. Birkin, an outspoken advocate for women and LGBTQ rights, was beloved in her adopted home of France. “The most Parisian of the English has left us,” Paris’s mayor Anne Hidalgo tweeted. “We will never forget her songs, her laughs and her incomparable accent which have always accompanied us.”</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ambrose-d740cf2429797478e9acde7c3cc94644@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>‘I Love You, Me Neither’: Images From Jane and Serge: A Family Album&nbsp;</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cja2onuej0018vey6zldzfygy@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Charlotte Gainsbourg Gets Personal</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.thecut.com/_pages/cjcm7qmps008o2qy6pe71xx6q@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Catching Up With Jane Birkin Before She Takes Carnegie Hall</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Jane Birkin, Actor, Singer, and Fashion Icon, Dead at 76</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdgbHyrrc2eZJuhoqC2r3nAnKuoql2otq%2BzxKtkmqaUYrOiv8eipqdlmZi8r3nDnpidZZGpeniCjaGrpqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./snl-jason-momoa-monologue-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Momoas SNL Monologue Goes Swimmingly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-franco-movies.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Franco Movies: His 10 Best Appearances So Far</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

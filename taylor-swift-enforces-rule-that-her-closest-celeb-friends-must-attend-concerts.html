Some of the rules seem to be logical, while the others are down right bizarre, and sound ego-driven more than anything else. As expected, fans are sounding off on some of the rules, and don't exactly agree with them. We'll reveal which rules sound problematic, along with taking a look at Swift's traumatic past with friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Is Taylor Swift's 'Speak Now' Really Written About Hayley Williams From Paramore?</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-swift-admitted-to-struggling-with-friendships-in-the-current-day-because-of-childhood-trauma>Taylor Swift Admitted To Struggling With Friendships In The Current Day Because Of Childhood Trauma</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/th-image-template-36.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rarely did Taylor Swift discuss her friendships throughout her career, despite the fact that the topic was often thrust into the headlines. She finally did discuss the topic during her candid thoughts in, 30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift admitted that her childhood had major implications on how she perceived friendships</a>.</p><p>“Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my 20s, I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone,” the artist revealed.</p><p>“It’s important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Did Joe Alwyn Really Date Emma Laird After His Brutal Breakup With Taylor Swift?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems like Taylor might be forcing her friends into something else as well... but her fans aren't necessarily buying into it.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-apparently-forces-her-celeb-friends-to-attend-concerts-but-fans-completely-disagree-with-the-legitimacy-of-the-39-rule-39>Taylor Swift Apparently Forces Her Celeb Friends To Attend Concerts, But Fans Completely Disagree With The Legitimacy Of The 'Rule'</h2><p>Several publications have listed off some of Taylor Swift's rules while on tour, and with her peers. Heck, certain tabloids have also speculated on the rules she has set for boyfriends in the past...</p><p>Some rules had fans scratching their heads, especially the diehard Swift army. One rule in particular claims that Taylor has a rule for her close celebrity friends, which is that they must attend her concerts. This is deemed as a way for Swift to get extra exposure. We don't think Taylor needs the extra love given her massive stardom... Fans weren't so sure about this apparent rule.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One fan writes, "Omg the whole "she forces her celebrity friends to attend at least one of her concerts." I'm sorry but Taylor is not like that."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>These Celebrities Are Massive Swifties Despite Barely Knowing Taylor Swift</a></span></p><p>Taylor did not confirm or deny this type of rumor. However, she has been honest about losing friends along the way, but still hanging on the memories.</p><p>Swift revealed, "Maybe they’ll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It’s sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you’ll always keep the memories."</p><p>Taylor did admit that friendships don't always last, but the rule still seems to be far-fetched. As it turns out, it wasn't the only apparent 'rule' that angered fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-also-disagree-with-another-taylor-swift-39-rule-39-that-claims-the-artist-charges-for-meet-and-greets-backstage>Fans Also Disagree With Another Taylor Swift 'Rule' That Claims The Artist Charges For Meet And Greets Backstage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/what-really-happened-during-the-screening-process-for-fans-who-were-invited-to-taylor-swift-s-house-for-her-album-listening-party.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Among the other apparent rules</a> that infuriated fans is the assumption that Taylor Swift and her team charge for meet and greets behind the scenes. Several fans of Taylor's army felt the need to address this, completely denying the validity.</p><p>One fan writes, "On tour Taylor often has a special room for the superfans who purchase meet and greet tickets" CORRECTION. her meet and greets are always FREE."</p><p>"Taylor doesn't sell meet and greets EVER. She either chooses you, her mom, or Taylor Nation who are on the lookout for hardcore fans. Not to mention, she also handpicks her fans to go to her home and they get to listen to the album first before it's even released. AND her celeb friends are not forced to attend, she lets them choose any show they wish to go."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another fan adds, "I am sorry but there is no such thing as purchasing meet and greet tickets for Taylor’s concert. Her mom goes around the stadium and picks out fans who are deserving to meet Taylor. And Taylor also picks fans to meet her. Taylor would never charge for meet and greet."</p><p>It seems clear that Swift and her team have a different process when it comes to meeting the star - and not one that involves any type of monetary gain, despite what the rumors suggest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1llaOzsL7CnqpmqqWhsm7Ax5qrZqCVp3qkuM6snKysXZiyrbHBZp2roZWjsbR5zK6qrWWRqcGmusNmmqimk5q%2Ftb%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2021-forgotten-athletes-who-are-languishing-in-jail.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Forgotten Athletes Who Are Languishing In Jail</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./every-time-travis-kelce-attended-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-shows.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Every Time Travis Kelce Attended Taylor Swift's 'Eras Tour' Shows</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

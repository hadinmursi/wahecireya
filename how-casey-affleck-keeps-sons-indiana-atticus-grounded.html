They’re not even really that interested in the movies. They just don’t seem to care that much, and I hope that’s because around the house we just talk about other stuff. It’s not their whole world.”</p><p>He added: “I have had lots of conversations with them about the challenges of being in a family where some people are in the public eye, and they’ve seen a lot of things. … Because I talked to them about that very early on, I think now it’s just, like, old hacks for them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Casey-Affleck-Keeps-His-Sons-Grounded-still.jpg><p>The actor, who shares Indiana, 15, and Atticus, 11, with <a href=#>his ex-wife, <strong>Summer Phoenix</strong>,</a> opened up to Us about his favorite way to spend time with his sons.</p><p>In addition to playing sports, listening to music and reading, the Boston native&nbsp;admitted to Us that he likes to put the boys to work. “One thing I really like to do is, as soon as they say that they’re bored, is just give them a job,” Affleck explained. “So if there’s something that needs to be done, I really like to wait them out. I just create no fun happening around the house for us. … Soon enough, they’re like, ‘We’re bored!’ and I’m like, ‘Great! There are three loads of laundry that need to be done.’”</p><p>The Manchester&nbsp;By the Sea star&nbsp;also enjoys watching his youngest sell “overpriced” lemonade and baked goods in their neighborhood. “He’s a hustler,” Affleck told Us.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He pulled from his bond with his sons while writing his new movie Light of My Life, telling Us, “[I was] incorporating conversations and situations from my relationship with my kids and putting in the scenes. It was a great way of making those characters really alive to me, and also it strangely helped me understand the conversations that I had with my kids better in reading the scenes and thinking about them and sort of analyzing them from a different perspective.”</p><p>Light of My Life premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in February. The movie will be released in NYC and L.A. theaters on August 2, expanding to 100 screens and video on demand on August 9.</p><p>With reporting by Carly Sloane</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGahp6disKK%2FxLJkmp6WobKkt4yknJ6oo2LAsLrSZqCnnJmWu6J5wK2ropulqHqovs6upZ2dlGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./j-balvin-usher-dj-khaled-dientes-yeah-interpolation-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>J Balvin Is Dancing With Himself in the Video to Dientes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./honey-j-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Honey J Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

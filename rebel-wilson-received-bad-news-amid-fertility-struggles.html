To all the women out there struggling with fertility, I feel ya. The universe works in mysterious ways and sometimes it all doesn’t make sense, but I hope there’s light about to shine through all the dark clouds.”</p><p>In the somber shot, the Aussie stood at the beach in a black sweatsuit, looking away from the camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Rebel-Wilson-Struggling-Fertility.jpg><p>The Bridesmaids star has been sharing her <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> journey in the last year, revealing in December 2020 that her fertility inspired her “year of health.”</p><p>“[I knew that I] wasn’t gonna maybe work that much this year,” the Pitch Perfect star explained in an Instagram post at the time. “I knew I was going to have a bit more time. I was also freezing my eggs because — as all good, career women out there should note — that if that’s something that interests you, it’s a pretty good time to do it. I was thinking about fertility and <a href=#>having good quality eggs in the bank</a>, so I was like, ‘OK, I’m going to do this. I’m going to get healthy.’”</p><p>The singer, who went to a “professional place to do a <a href=# data-link=1>detox</a>,” wrote that she had lost about 61 pounds.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The goal was never to be skinny. It was never to fit into a certain dress size,” Wilson concluded at the time. “I put in a goal weight, [165 pounds], because I needed some tangible thing. … What I’m proud of myself is doing that and having a lot more balance now in my life.”</p><p>The comedian was dating businessman <strong>Jacob Busch</strong> at the time, but<a href=#> they split in February</a>. Wilson told Extra later that same month that she was<a href=#> in a “really good place”</a> following their breakup. “I feel like, I don’t know if it’s turning 40 or coming into your own,” she added. “Any kind of breakup is hard and not ideal.”</p><p>The Super Fun Night star explained to the outlet that the relationship had “run its course,” noting, “I am so busy with work, doing [my competitive dog grooming show] Pooch Perfect now, and I have three movies to shoot after this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGarnZKauW7DyKWqqKZdp7KkscivnJ1lkpaxbrrEsKpmmZ2esW6yxKuroqSZqcZuv9OrrKCfnJrAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./roderick-henry-greenfield-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-55133-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Roderick Henry Greenfield Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biogr</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./philip-winchester-and-wife-megan-are-expecting-baby-no-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Philip Winchester and Wife Megan Are Expecting Baby No. 2</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

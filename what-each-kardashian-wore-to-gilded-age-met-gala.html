The 2022 Met Gala certainly exceeded expectations. This year's theme, Gilded Glamour, was intended by the party organisers to allow celebrity guests to really embrace late 19th century excessiveness - think petticoats, bustles, and lots and lots of lace. While some invitees really embraced the chosen theme (think Billie Eilish's stunning recycled silk ensemble), others rather missed the mark and decided to interpret the theme very differently - leading to surprise, controversy, and even outrage. This year, all of the Kardashian clan were on the guest list and, as you might imagine, they certainly made sartorial statements on the red carpet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="This Explains Why Pete Davidson Got Tattoos In Honor Of Kim's Kids">This Explains Why Pete Davidson Got Tattoos In Honor Of Kim's Kids</a></span></p><p>Here's a full breakdown of what <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> and her family members wore to this year's Met Gala.</p><h2 id=here-39-s-what-kourtney-kardashian-wore><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Here's What Kourtney Kardashian Wore</span></h2><p>Kourtney put a modern spin on the theme with a Thom Browne ensemble. The outfit consisted of a cropped white shirt, paired with a long black skirt which was worn over a corset-like skin tone wrap. The reality star paired her look with black court shoes and a black bag, with her hair styled in an elegant up-do. Kourtney fared best with fashion commentators for her look, which they claimed paid best homage to the theme out of all the Kardashians.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=khloe-kardashian-embraced-the-39-gilded-39-part-of-the-theme><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Khloe Kardashian Embraced The 'Gilded' Part Of The Theme</span></h2><p>Khloe certainly got the 'gilded' part nailed with her custom Moschino evening dress, which had over half a million hand-sewn beads!</p><p>Writing on Instagram, Khloe said: 'An unforgettable evening at The Met. I am so incredibly honored to have been invited and so grateful to <a href=#>@JeremyScott</a> for creating this gorgeous custom-made fringe column gown with 540,000 hand sewn glass beads in just 10 days! To say the last couple of weeks have been a rollercoaster is an understatement, but last night made it all worth it. It was a huge honor to wear <a href=#>@moschino</a> on this night that I will never forget. Thank you, thank you, thank you Jeremy, Laura, Stefan, Brooke and the team at Moschino, <a href=#>@voguemagazine</a><a href=#>@metcostumeinstutute</a><a href=#>#AnnaWintour</a>!! Thank you <a href=#>@chrisappleton1</a> and <a href=#>@makeupbymario</a> for making me feel beautiful for my first Met - and <a href=#>@lorraineschwartz</a> for letting me wear the most gorgeous diamond earrings I’ve ever worn in my life. Thank you all for your love and kindness, as always.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Khloe paired the look with long black evening gloves and matching wrap, with slight reference to late Victorian fashion, and wore her blonde locks in a slicked, wet-look 'do.</p><h2 id=kendall-got-the-long-dress-train-down><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kendall Got The Long Dress Train Down</span></h2><p>Kendall also paid a some homage to the Gilded Age with an extravagant long train on her black Prada evening gown. The enormous dress consisted of two parts; a large black silk skirt with overlapping folds and ruched edges, worn together with a fitted, mesh detailed top. Kendall wore her hair down, with delicate earrings.</p><h2 id=her-after-party-look-raised-eyebrows-however><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Her After-Party Look Raised Eyebrows, However</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kendall was a little more risque at the after-party, however, wearing a two-piece lace ensemble consisting of a black lace cami top and matching cropped trousers - with brown silk underwear visible beneath. Kendall paired the daring outfit with black stilettos.</p><h2 id=kylie-made-many-worst-dressed-lists><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kylie Made Many Worst-Dressed Lists</span></h2><p>Kylie Jenner's bridal-inspired look certainly turned heads on the evening. The Kylie Beauty founder wore a large Off-White evening gown which consisted of a wide white ruffled skirt with strapless top, worn with a mesh t-shirt underneath. Kylie completed the look with a backwards-facing baseball cap and short veil. Kylie wore the look in honor of her late friend, designer Virgil Abloh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the gown had personal meaning for Kylie, and she appeared thrilled to be sporting it, many fashion experts were unimpressed with her choice - feeling it was incohesive and totally failed to grasp the night's set theme.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Do Nutritionists Approve Of Kim Kardashian's Met Gala Diet?">Do Nutritionists Approve Of Kim Kardashian's Met Gala Diet?</a></span></p><h2 id=her-after-party-look-was-a-lot-more-popular><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Her After-Party Look Was A Lot More Popular</span></h2><p>Conversely, Kylie's after-party look was hailed as one of the best of the night - perfectly capturing the corsetry and silhouettes which defined the era of the Gilded Age. The ensemble consisted of a silk dress with long straight skirt and a corset body with gauze sleeves and evening gloves.</p><p>'should have just worn this for the actual met,' cried frustrated fans in the comments of her Instagram post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kris-completely-missed-the-theme><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kris Completely Missed The Theme</span></h2><p>Momager Kris Jenner was another one to mostly ignore the evening's Gilded Glamour theme, opting for a Jackie Kennedy-inspired look by Oscar de la Renta. The yellow, one-shoulder dress with sequin detailing on the hem was worn with white evening gloves, a small silver bag, and with a flippy, 60s hairdo.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="The Real Reason Kim Kardashian And Ray J Broke Up">The Real Reason Kim Kardashian And Ray J Broke Up</a></span></p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-stole-the-night><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Stole The Night</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And now, finally, for the most infamous and controversial Kardashian outfit of the evening: Kim Kardashian's Marilyn Monroe look. Kim borrowed the vintage 1962 Jean Louis crystal gown from owners Ripley's Believe It Or Not. The strappy, body-hugging gown was meant to match the skin tone of its original wearer Marilyn Monroe, and was paired by Kim with a white fur shawl (some think to conceal the unclosed zip at the back of the gown). Kim dyed her raven locks bleached blonde for the event, and wore her hair slicked back in a bun. Diamond earrings completed the glamorous look.</p><p>Kim's outfit choice literally broke the internet on the night, and <a href=#>her decision to wear the vintage piece has divided the fashion world.</a></p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Blac Chyna Goes After Judge Who Dismissed Her Kardashian Lawsuit ">Blac Chyna Goes After Judge Who Dismissed Her Kardashian Lawsuit</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrKir8dmopqqlJbAqbXAp2Swp6KaerW7jKCgpZyVmXqis8RmpJ6sXZyura2O</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-old-is-masterchef-junior-contestant-chad-gibbs-information-about-jidion.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How old is MasterChef Junior contestant Chad Gibbs?

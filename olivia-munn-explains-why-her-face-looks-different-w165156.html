I barely recognize her as @oliviamunn,” another added, while commented: “I think she did the nose job.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BBwh0fnMmdS/</p><p><span>According to Munn, however, she’s just lost weight, did a ton of research about aging naturally, reshaped her eyebrows and apparently found magical potatoes high in hyaluronic acid that we can’t wait to get our hands on.</span></p><p><span>See below for her </span><a href=#>detailed explanation</a><span> in full:</span></p><p>“Ask anyone who knows me and they’ll tell you I love research. Convinced that there’s got to be natural, healthy ways (ie not only the rich and connected can do it) to keep your skin from aging, I do lots of research.</p><p>Who says guys are the only ones who can get better with age? We’re gonna turn that myth around, if we share what we learn with each other. So here are 4 skin tips I’ve learned just over this past year that really helped the texture and shape of my face.</p><p>Left Pic: 1 year ago. Right Pic: Last month.</p><p>1. I lost 12 pounds this past year while training for Xmen. I kept it off by coming up w/an hour workout I do a few times a week. The weight loss leaned out my cheeks and jawline. Working out is also great for your skin because it increases blood flow to your face which helps rejuvenate.</p><p>2. Reshaped my brows. I do my own brows and always thought they were supposed to have a high arch. Then a facialist pointed out to me that I was shaping my brows into a frown. So I let the top of my brows grow in (which is never fun because it looks spotty for a few weeks) and then I plucked the bottom. That gave my brows a more horizontal angle and instantly brightened my eyes.</p><p>3. Got rid of sunspots. I love my freckles. But over the past couple of years I’ve seen more come up and merge with other freckles to make large dark spots. Dark spots prevent your skin from reflecting light and gives you a dull complexion. So for the past year I’ve been diligently using @Proactiv Mark Fading Pads. I wipe my face with one every night and now my face has a more even tone and the large spots aren’t as noticeable.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>4. I’ve talked about this before and I still stand by it: Japanese potatoes that are high in Hyaluronic Acid help keep wrinkles away. Look up this video: ‘Connie Chung Yuzihara’ to learn all about it. There are Hyaluronic Acid pills and vitamins but I think that the best way to get it in your system is by eating them in foods that naturally have them.</p><p>I’m still looking into what gets rid of the lines that develop around your neck. I think it has to do with tension and acupuncture might be the answer. When I find out more, I’ll let you know. 👯👍”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6S5qsLImmSmrZ6jeqbEz6WYoqajYsSpxYyhnKtllpawpnnLqKakq12ZtqeyxKucp6xdrH53gZBubWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./oscars-kodak-theater-dolby-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Oscars Staying in Newly Named Dolby Theater</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nicole-raviv-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-91618-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nicole Raviv Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

Prior to marrying <a href=#><strong>Nikki Bella</strong></a> in August 2022, <a href=#><strong>Artem Chigvintsev</strong></a> — who shares <a href=#>son Matteo</a> with the former WWE personality — dated others in the spotlight before settling down.</p><p>The Russia native, who was part of Burn the Floor and Strictly Come Dancing before joining <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>, has been romantically linked to many fellow dancers over the years. While not all his exes are still part of his life, one has a big impact on his weekly schedule.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Carrie Ann Inaba</strong></a>, who is <a href=#>currently a judge on the ABC competition series</a>, was in a relationship with Chigvintsev for two and a half years between 2006 and 2009. She hasn’t given him any special treatment over the years though. In fact, during season 29 of the show, fans on social media speculated that she was being tough on him and partner <a href=#><strong>Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong></a> because<a href=#> of their past</a>.</p><p>“I think it’s hysterical. You know what I love though? This is what I love about the <a href=#>Bachelor</a> fans and <a href=#>Bachelorette</a> fans. They can create a story around it!” Inaba told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> and other reporters in November 2020. “And it’s weird because I totally understood what they were doing. They’re like, there’s jealousy there and there’s this and that because that’s what the Bachelor and Bachelorette is all about, right? It’s about creating stories about everybody.”</p><p>The longtime judge went on to deny that she gave Chigvintsev or anyone on the series special treatment, pointing out that she is friends with her ex and his love Bella.</p><p>“I love Artem, I respect him, I love him and Nikki together. I love that they just had their little baby Matteo. There’s nothing but love and I thought it was hysterical,” she continued. “So none of it bothers me. I know that people are passionate about <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>. They’re passionate about who they’re voting for. I love that.”</p><p>Bella, for her part, also joked about the Hawaii native’s history with Chigvintsev in 2019, noting that if the judge’s save was part of the season they competed on together, <a href=#>maybe they would have “lasted longer”</a> than they did.</p><p>“I think Carrie Ann totally would have saved us. And not because you guys dated … but she really liked my technique,” the Total Bellas star said during Entertainment Tonight at the time. During the live show, the dancer immediately began blushing and covered his face.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite their past relationships, Bella and Chigvintsev are in a great place.</p><p>“Artem treats Nikki like a queen. He’s such a great guy and <a href=#>madly in love with her</a>,” an insider exclusively told Us in June 2020, <a href=#>two years before the duo tied the knot</a>. “She’s his dream girl, and she is super sweet to him. Their friends love them as a couple.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see who else Chigvintsev has dated — and who he married — through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkrrPAxKZknKCZnMOqutOsnK%2BrXZmutbXNoGShoaOpvLPFjqCgrJ2cobJuvMSamqibm2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1437186-ash-by-elegance-dana-brooke-doesnt-believe-wwe-had-confidence-in-her-skills.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ash By Elegance (Dana Brooke) Doesnt Believe WWE Had Confidence In Her Skills</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aneurin-barnard-is-portrayed-as-a-daniel-solace-in-a-suspense-horror-series-1899-489541-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Aneurin Barnard Is Portrayed As A Daniel Solace In A Suspense Horror Series 1899</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

Previously, Clark denied allegations that he sent inappropriate messages to individuals who claimed that they were underage. In August 2022, he was arrested twice within a week on misdemeanor charges of battery and trespass on property after warning.</p><p>In a new video on his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram page</a>, Patrick Clark apologized to WWE, Shawn Michaels, his family, and Ashante “Thee” Adonis.</p><p>“As you’ve probably seen or heard over the course of the last few years, I want to apologize for my behavior,” Velveteen Dream said. “Both professionally and personally, I always preach to those closest to me about the power of accountability and responsibility. I take full accountability for my behavior over the last three years of my life. What narratives were written about me, it doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter what was written about me, it doesn’t matter what was said about me, it doesn’t matter what’s on the internet about me. I was wrong. Because of that, I need to apologize to a few people.</p><p>“First I want to apologize to the WWE organization. I want to apologize to the WWE organization for any unwanted attention and negative press that I brought to your brand and your product. I want to apologize to the WWE fans and the Velveteen Dream fans because when you hear the name Velveteen Dream, it should have only been spoken about in a productive and a positive light. Not the name Patrick Clark as another statistic of what happens when talent and opportunity meet immaturity. That’s not what you spent your hard-earned money on. It’s not what you invest your time and your money in. When you look on the TV and you come to the shows, you should escape reality, not have to deal with mine.”</p><h2 id=h-velveteen-dream-apologizes-to-triple-h-and-shawn-michaels>Velveteen Dream Apologizes To Triple H And Shawn Michaels</h2><p>Velveteen Dream continued by apologizing to Triple H and Shawn Michaels. He made it clear that he was appreciative of being able to work with both men and learn from them. Velveteen Dream stated that he is still a work in progress, and he is still learning.</p><p>“I want to apologize to the WWE and the fans,” he said. “I want to apologize to Paul Levesque. Paul, you are such an understanding, patient man and leader. Getting the opportunity to work with you and learn from you, I get the sense of what makes you who you are, and how you’ve been able to handle the responsibility of being in the public light for such a long time. I want to apologize to you, Paul, I’m sorry. Also, I want to say I’m sorry to Shawn Michaels.</p><p>“Shawn, it’s still beyond me that I’ve been having the opportunity in this lifetime to learn from you, to have your mentorship and your guidance, and I apologize if you feel like you’ve wasted your time and your energy investing into me. You have not. I’m still a work in progress, I’m still learning, and I remember all the lessons that you taught me. Shawn, I’m sorry. My best friend, Tehuti Miles, I want to apologize to you because before you were tied to me publicly, for the support you’ve given me and you continue to give me, your resume was impeccable, and I apologize for any smudges that I may have put on that resume because of my behavior. You’re the last person that should have to deal with anything like that, and I’m sorry.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-velveteen-dream-tells-his-family-he-s-sorry>Velveteen Dream Tells His Family He’s Sorry</h2><p>Velveteen Dream then apologized to his family. He said he’s sorry for any negative energy that has come their way because of him and his behavior. He stated that he was losing himself, and he apologized to anyone he has upset or offended.</p><p>“I want to apologize to my family, my mom, my dad, my brother, my sister, my nieces, and my nephews because you may read things, you may hear about things,” he said. “You may be confronted by people you don’t know, and you might feel the need to explain yourselves on my behalf. I just want you to know that you do not have to do that, ever. No one should have to explain anything for Patrick Clark, no one should have to trend because of Patrick Clark. No one should have to answer the questions, ‘Where’s Patrick now? What did Patrick do? What happened with Patrick?’</p><p>“That’s not your responsibility, and I don’t want you to feel burdened with that responsibility. That’s my responsibility. I apologize to you all for any negative energy that has had to come your way because of me. Again, I want to apologize to the fans and those in my professional and personal life that I’ve affected by my behavior. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I recognize that I was losing myself, and I apologize to anyone that I lost along the way, to anyone that I’ve upset or offended because of my behavior. I’m sorry, and I hope you all forgive me. Thank you.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsamxoZWK9osDRopqkZZOhrrO3jK%2Bcpa6VqbKmuoydqZ6ZnWKusbvLqJ6ispWoerW7jLCunmWkp7axuMRmn2aZnpl6rrvRnmSipl2jsrh51aKbnqc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pink-chooses-taylor-swift-or-katy-perry-w498406.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pink Chooses: Taylor Swift or Katy Perry?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./black-friday-vacuum-best-deals-2020.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Our Picks: Black Friday Vacuum Deals on Dyson, Cordless &amp;amp; Robot Cleaners 2020</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

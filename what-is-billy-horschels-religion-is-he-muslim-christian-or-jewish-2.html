The second and third wins of his career came at an ideal time for the six-year PGA Tour veteran.</p><p>He won two events, including the Tour Championship, during the 2014 FedEx Cup playoffs to earn the $10 million bonus awarded to the FedEx Cup champion.</p><p>It brought his total prize money over the last year to $16 million.

He stated on his website, “My father promised to take me to the golf course once I could consistently hit balls over the pond.”</p><p>“I practiced for hours and hours until I was finally able to cross the pond.”</p><p>He had some junior golf experience, but because we couldn’t afford to travel to many events, he wasn’t highly recruited. After being passed over by several other schools, UF coach Buddy Alexander took a chance on him.</p><p>He successfully qualified for the 2010 PGA Tour through qualifying school in December 2009. A wrist injury limited Horschel to four PGA Tour events that year, and he did not make the cut in any of them.</p><p>In December 2010, he regained his Tour Card through qualifying school to supplement his medical extension in the event that he did not earn enough to secure his Tour Card.</p><p>In February 2011, he made the cut at the Mayakoba Golf Classic, his first PGA Tour appearance in eleven years, finishing T13. Horschel finished the season ranked 140th on the money list, earning him conditional eligibility for 2012.</p><p>Since then, he has won several tournaments, including the Tour Championship and the FedEx Cup. Horschel defeated Jason Day in a playoff to win the AT&T Byron Nelson in May 2017.</p><p>Horschel and partner Scott Piercy won the Zurich Classic of New Orleans in April 2018.

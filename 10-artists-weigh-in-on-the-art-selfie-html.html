And DIS published a whole book of the popular #artselfie hashtag from Instagram. Which has us wondering: Will selfies ultimately prove the biggest&nbsp;<a href=#>boost to museum attendance</a>&nbsp;ever? Does “being seen with the artworks count as much, if not more, than the work,” as the&nbsp;<a href=#>New York<i> Times&nbsp;</i>suggested in its official trend piece&nbsp;</a>on the matter? Did white people’s selfies&nbsp;<a href=#>make a mockery</a>&nbsp;of Kara Walker’s sugar sphinx? It’s hard to say, but Walker herself seemed fairly&nbsp;<a href=#>unfazed</a>. Which is why we decided to go to ask artists what they really think about people taking selfies with their work. Here’s what ten had to say.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e8d671a2876c555cb612691fd2641605-4-0-0@published data-word-count=40><strong>ERIC FISCHL</strong><br>“Was it John Berger or Susan Sontag who observed that the camera (a memory device), ironically, allows us to forget. So what is forgotten when the selfie is taken? I think it reduces the whole world to a non-experience.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e8d671a2876c555cb612691fd2641605-5-0-0@published data-word-count=55><strong>WILL COTTON</strong><br>“I look at Instagram quite a lot. I’m happy to see people photographing my work, with with or without themselves in the picture. There’s something about including themselves that suggests pilgrimage, like taking a picture of yourself in front of a recognizable landmark as proof that you were there. I appreciate and understand that.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e8d671a2876c555cb612691fd2641605-6-0-0@published data-word-count=39><strong>MARLENE DUMAS</strong><br>“I find this whole selfie rage so stupid … The desire of tourists to stand in front of things and buildings or whatever, and send pictures home, is as old as ever. It is really childish, but harmless.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e8d671a2876c555cb612691fd2641605-7-0-0@published data-word-count=41><strong>ANTONY GORMLEY</strong><br>“Part of sculpture’s core purpose is to remind us of time: Sculpture is lived time inscribed in geological time. There is the time of making, the time of seeing, and the time of remembering: Selfies relate to the last two.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e8d671a2876c555cb612691fd2641605-8-0-0@published data-word-count=39><strong>TONY FEHER</strong><br>“Picasso and Dalí would have turned the camera on themselves more often had it been as easy as today.

I raised a fistful of sugar to let it fall through my hands like a stream. When I looked at what I thought was a perfectly innocent iPhone picture, it just looked incredibly lewd (just by accident), so I never posted it.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e8d671a2876c555cb612691fd2641605-11-0-0@published data-word-count=13><strong>ANDREA FRASER</strong><br>“I can’t recall ever having seen a selfie with my work …”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e8d671a2876c555cb612691fd2641605-12-0-0@published data-word-count=51><strong>ENOC PEREZ</strong><br>“I’m not sure if it is possible to make a respectful selfie. I’ve seen dignified selfies that are funny. I prefer the irreverent, narcissistic selfie. It is just better. To me, the selfie is a very natural thing to do; if horses had cameras, they probably would take selfies, too.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-e8d671a2876c555cb612691fd2641605-13-0-0@published data-word-count=76><strong>SUZANNE LACY</strong><br>“I watched people taking lewd, and non-lewd, selfies at the Kara Walker piece — I couldn’t help associating that with race and gender, naturally, particularly the lewd ones. In a way, it added a nuance to the whole work, a piece I found I overwhelmingly moving. On the front, often-white youth posed happily under her watchful gaze; in the back, boys stuck out their tongues in a mimicry of the assaults on black women’s bodies.”</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>10 Artists Weigh in on the Art Selfie</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobWdhZ3xyfIyaqa2ho6nAbsPEop6hZZmjerC6jK2fnmWRp8Fuv8SlnaKdXp3Brrg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./movie-stars-who-appeared-on-90s-tv-shows-before-they-got-famous.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Movie Stars Who Appeared On '90s TV Shows Before They Got Famous</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./finding-dory-meet-the-new-characters-from-disney-sequel-w200933.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Finding Dory: Meet the New Characters From Disney Sequel</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

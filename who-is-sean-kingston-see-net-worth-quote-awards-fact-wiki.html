Sean Kingston rose to prominence in 2007, when he released a popular single called “Beautiful Girls”, which was featured on his self-titled debut album. Upon its release, “Beautiful Girls” peaked at #17 on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart and eventually made its way to the #1 position on the chart. Kingston’s single became so popular that it inspired many covers, including the ones made by Deer Tick, Teddy Geiger, Jesse McCartney, and David Archuleta to name a few. Soon after the release of the single, some artists made parodies of the song, the most notable ones being “Scariest Girl” by Kel Mitchell and “A Suicidal Song” by Sean Krapston. “Beautiful Girls” was also featured in a teen drama series called “Gossip Girl” starring Blake Lively, Chace Crawford and Taylor Momsen, as well as a Playstation 2 video game entitled “SingStar Hottest Hits”. “Beautiful Girls” brought Kingston a Teen Choice Award for Choice R&B Track. However, “Beautiful Girls” was not the only single to come out of Kingston’s debut work. In addition to selling more than 500 000 copies worldwide, “Sean Kingston” spawned such popular singles as “Me Love”, “Take You There” and “There’s Nothin”, all of which brought him international fame, as well as commercial success. A famous rap artist, how rich is Sean Kingston? According to sources, Sean Kingston’s net worth is estimated to be $2 million. Most of Sean Kingston’s net worth and wealth comes from his rapping career.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=sean-kingston-net-worth-2-million></span>Sean Kingston Net Worth $2 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Sean Kingston was born in 1990, in Miami, Florida, however, when he was a child, Kingston’s family relocated to the capital of Jamaica, Kingston. In Jamaica, Sean Kingston studied at the high school located in the Ocho Rios town. Kingston’s teenage years were filled with legal issues, as he was accused of burglary and, as a result, had to spend several weeks in jail. Around the same time, his mother was imprisoned for identity theft, while Kingston briefly had to live in a car. However, Kingston’s life turned around for the better when he was contacted by Tommy Rotem, who noticed his talent on Myspace website. Rotem offered him a record deal, and soon afterwards Kingston came out with his hit single “Beautiful Girls”, which was followed by the release of his self-titled studio album. Following the success of his debut work, in 2009, Sean Kingston released “Tomorrow”, his second studio album, which spawned such singles as “Fire Burning” and “Face Drop”. Unfortunately, the album failed to repeat the success of “Sean Kingston”, as it only peaked at #37 on the Billboard 200 chart, and sold slightly over 13 000 copies during its first week. Nevertheless, it did not prevent Kingston from releasing two mixtapes, namely “Yesterday” and “King of Kingz”, as well as a third studio album entitled “Back 2 Life”, which featured guest appearances from such artists as Chris Brown, 2 Chainz, Wiz Khalifa and T.I.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Sean Kingston</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 3, 1990</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Miami, Florida, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Rapper, Artist, Record producer, Musician, Music artist</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Janice Turner, Jack Ruby, Jr.</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Kisean Anderson , Kingston, Sean , Kisean Paul Anderson</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>http://www.facebook.com/seankingston</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>http://www.twitter.com/seankingston</td></tr><tr><td>Google+</td><td>http://plus.google.com/108961465858012263140</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>http://www.instagram.com/seankingston</td></tr><tr><td>MySpace</td><td>http://www.myspace.com/seankingston</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm2728031</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Teen Choice Award for Choice R&B Track</td></tr><tr><td>Albums</td><td>“Beautiful Girls” (2007), “Tomorrow” (2009), “Back 2 Life” (2012), “Yesterday” (2010) , “King of Kingz” (2001)</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Kids’ Choice Award for Favorite Male Singer, Kids’ Choice Award for Favorite Song, NAACP Image Award for Outstanding New Artist, MuchMusic Video Award for iHeartRadio International Artist of the Year, Latin Grammy Award for Best Urban Music Album, NRJ Music Award for International Song of the Year, …</td></tr></table><table class=quotes><tr><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I love Beyonce.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>It’s easy to gain weight when you’re in the studio.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I make sure I always surround myself with good, down to earth, fun, real people, who always keep me grounded.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I don’t think an artist should keep themselves categorized in a specific box.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>God is great.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I love song writing, so I’m always happy to write for other musicians.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>I think country has the biggest melodies ever.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>My goal is just to get healthy as far as what my ideal weight has to be for my height.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Hip-hop singer.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head><span class=ez-toc-section id=soundtrack></span>Soundtrack <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table class=soundtrack><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Baywatch</td><td>2017</td><td>performer: “Give It To Me Twice” / writer: “Give It To Me Twice” – as Kisean Anderson</td></tr><tr><td>Office Christmas Party</td><td>2016</td><td>performer: “Party All Night Sleep All Day”</td></tr><tr><td>Superstar Duets</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series writer – 1 episode</td></tr><tr><td>Todd’s Pop Song Reviews</td><td>TV Series documentary writer – 2 episodes, 2010 – 2014 performer – 1 episode, 2010</td></tr><tr><td>Girls</td><td>TV Series performer – 1 episode, 2013 writer – 1 episode, 2013</td></tr><tr><td>The Swan Princess Christmas</td><td>2012</td><td>performer: “Eenie Meenie” / writer: “Eenie Meenie”</td></tr><tr><td>Sarah G Live</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series writer – 1 episode</td></tr><tr><td>Dance Central 2</td><td>2011</td><td>Video Game “Fire Burning” / writer: “Fire Burning” – as Kisean Anderson</td></tr><tr><td>The Inbetweeners Movie</td><td>2011</td><td>performer: “Party All Night Sleep All Day”</td></tr><tr><td>Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</td><td>2011</td><td>Documentary performer: “Eenie Meenie” / writer: “Eenie Meenie” – as Kisean Paul Anderson</td></tr><tr><td>Just Go with It</td><td>2011</td><td>performer: “Fire Burning” / writer: “Fire Burning” – as Kisean Anderson</td></tr><tr><td>90210</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series 1 episode</td></tr><tr><td>The Suite Life on Deck</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series performer – 1 episode</td></tr><tr><td>The Town</td><td>2010</td><td>writer: “Whatcha Say” – as Kisean Anderson</td></tr><tr><td>Lottery Ticket</td><td>2010/I</td><td>performer: “My Hood” / writer: “My Hood” – as Kisean Anderson</td></tr><tr><td>Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore</td><td>2010</td><td>performer: “Why Can’t We Be Friends”</td></tr><tr><td>Marmaduke</td><td>2010</td><td>performer: “Eenie Meenie”, “Fire Burning” / writer: “Eenie Meenie”, “Fire Burning” – as Kisean Anderson</td></tr><tr><td>Sean Kingston Ft.

The twosome <a href=#>made their official red carpet debut</a> at the&nbsp;<i>Vanity Fair&nbsp;</i>Oscars party that February, continuing to date on and off for several years.</p><p class=p1>“I think a lot of my inspiration comes from [Selena],” Bieber told <a href=#><strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong></a> during an April 2015 <a href=#>radio interview</a>. “It was a long relationship that created heartbreak and created happiness and a lot of different emotions that I wanted to write about.”</p><p class=p1>During one of the pair’s splits in 2015, the Canada native was<a href=#> spotted making out with his now-wife</a>, <a href=#><strong>Hailey Bieber</strong></a> (née Baldwin).</p><p class=p1>“What if&nbsp;Hailey <a href=#>ends up being the girl I’m gonna marry</a>, right? If I rush into anything, if I damage her, then it’s always gonna be damaged,” Justin admitted to&nbsp;<a href=#><i>GQ</i></a>&nbsp;in March 2016. “It’s really hard to fix wounds like that. It’s so hard. … I just don’t want to hurt her.”</p><p class=p1>Despite getting closer to the model, Justin <a href=#>reconciled with the Disney Channel alum in November 2017</a> before <a href=#>splitting for good nearly one year later</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I was, you know, obviously going through a really tough breakup, and then I was left with the question of my career and where am I gonna go and what’s gonna happen?” Gomez <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;</i>in a June 2022 interview</a> about navigating their public split. “And then my medical stuff kind of kicked in, but being on the other side of it, I have to be honest, it’s actually been really good for me.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “[Our breakup] <a href=#>allowed me to develop a character where</a> I don’t tolerate any sort of nonsense or disrespect. It was necessary for me to walk through those things, I had a lot of soul searching to do. By all means, I don’t have life figured out, but I do know that during that time I was learning so much about myself.”</p><p class=p1>Less than one year after Gomez and the Grammy winner split for good, <a href=#>he married Hailey in September 2018</a>. Despite the “Yummy” singer and the Guess model’s wedded bliss, Jelena fans <a href=#>still criticized Hailey for allegedly getting in between the now-exes</a>.</p><p class=p1>“It’s hard for me to talk about this because I don’t want to talk on either one of their behalf because it was their relationship,” the Rhode founder said during <a href=#>a September 2022 appearance on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast</a>. “I honestly <a href=#>respect that very deeply</a>, but I just know what was going on when we got back together. And I know what had to happen for that to come back together in a healthy way, and I think it was the most healthy, mature decision that he could have made and I respect that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Gomez, for her part, <a href=#>has since been linked</a> to <a href=#><strong>The Weeknd</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Zedd</strong></a>,<a href=#> <strong>Niall Horan</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Charlie Puth</strong></a> following her split from Justin.</p><p class=p1>Scroll through to look back on their relationship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt7a%2F06KlZpqZmq%2BmvoyapZ1lo5q5prrAZp6opZWverW0xGaumrFdqbWmxYywnKudXWd9cn6QaWhqZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-broderick-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Broderick Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joie-chavis-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-639593-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joie Chavis Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

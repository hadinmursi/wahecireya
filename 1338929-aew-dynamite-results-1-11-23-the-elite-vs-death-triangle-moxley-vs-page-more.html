Cole makes it clear that he was really banged up, and he had two back-to-back “very serious head injuries”. He says he was seeing doctors multiple times a week, and he was going through a rough time.

He says the fans have been there for him, and he is eternally grateful for that. Cole then shifts to the bad news.</p><p>He says the bad news is for the AEW locker room because Adam Cole is back.

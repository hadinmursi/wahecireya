Celebs like Harry Styles, Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj have given back to their fans in big ways, so big, that they've even changed their lives. That's what fan appreciation is all about!</p><h2 id=harry-styles><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Harry Styles</span></h2><p><a href=#>Harry Styles</a> has the motto, "Treat people with kindness," and Harry definitely practices what he&nbsp;preaches. Recently, Harry's car broke down outside of a fan's home. He rang the doorbell to have somewhere to wait while they fixed his car. Unfortunately, Theadora, the fan whose house he was hanging out at, wasn't home at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Married Their Fans</a></span></p><p>Harry, being Harry, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">left her a note</a>: "Theadora, my car broke down on your street and your dad's friend kindly let me wait at your house with a cup of tea. I'm devastated that we missed each other. Looking forward to meeting soon. Treat people with kindness. All my love, Harry. P.S. I fed the fish." He also included a photo of himself feeding the fish. He also left a second note saying "Tell your dad to get in touch and I'll see you at a show" with an autograph on his album in her room.</p><h2>Keith Urban</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Keith Urban</a> is another celebrity who has gone above and beyond for a fan. One of his biggest fans, Marissa English, was on hospice care and wasn't able to go to his concert even though she had tickets. Her health was declining, so her nurses tried their hardest to reach out to him to see if he could make a video or something. Luckily for her, he made a surprise visit to the hospital where he gave her a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">private serenade</a> before his concert. He even took a few photos with her, making her dreams come true despite everything she was going through.</p><h2 id=ed-sheeran><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ed Sheeran</span></h2><p><a href=#>Ed Sheeran</a> is so thankful for his hands that he went above and beyond for a fan named Melody Driscoll. Melody was suffering from Rett syndrome and was in the hospital for most of her life. One of the bright spots in her life was Ed and his music. Her parents created a social media plea to try and get Ed to meet their daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Times Celebrities Photobombed Their Fans</a></span></p><p>Of course, Ed saw and went to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">visit her at the hospital</a> where he sang to her and spend a lot of time with her, absolutely making her day. Sadly, Melody passed away two years later when she was just 11 years old. Ed even attended her funeral to pay his respects to the little girl that made such an impact on his life.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Miley Cyrus</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of <a href=#>Miley Cyrus'</a> biggest fans, Matt Peterson asked the singer to prom, but she sadly had to turn him down due to scheduling conflicts. She made up for it though, as she had him go to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">concert in Arizona</a>. At the concert, she staged prom photos for him where they took the classic photos and some of their own. Matt even dressed in a tuxedo covered in pictures of Miley's tongue. She let him take as many pictures as he wanted and even took things a step further by taking him on stage during the concert. That definitely made up for not being able to go to his prom.</p><h2 id=nicki-minaj><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Nicki Minaj</span></h2><p><a href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> gave back to her fans in a really big way. She started up a "competition" called "Student of the Game" where her fans would tweet their college expenses that they needed to pay off — tuition, books, accommodations — to Nicki along with the #StudentOfTheGame. Nicki, along with her team, went through all of the entries where she selected 37 winners. The winners had their student loan debts or their college tuition <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">paid off by Nicki</a>, who tweeted that she was so proud that so many of her fans were working hard in college.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=johnny-depp><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Johnny Depp</span></h2><p><a href=#>Johnny Depp</a> is a star who loves to give back to his fans, especially those who are sick and are having a hard time. Johnny is no stranger to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">visiting hospitals</a>, especially pediatric hospitals. Although fans love Johnny just the way he is, when he goes to visit sick children he often dresses up as his infamous character, Captain Jack Sparrow. He goes into full costume and character, spending time with the sick patients and their families. It's something that he enjoys doing and has done it on multiple occasions.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Taylor Swift</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If there's one thing we know it's that <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> loves her fans and loves to give back to them. Recently, throughout the pandemic, it's no secret that many people have been struggling financially and have lost their jobs. One of Taylor's fans tweeted about how she was unable to donate to one of Taylor's charities because she was unemployed. Taylor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reached out</a> to the fan saying that she saw her tweet about being stressed out about money. That's not all — she even sent her $3,000 to help her out in her time of need.</p><h2 id=jon-bon-jovi><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jon Bon Jovi</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Jon Bon Jovi</a> gave back to one of his biggest fans in the best way. Branka Delic was set to get married in Las Vegas, and with the help of social media, she pleaded to have him <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">walk her down the aisle</a>. He was playing a show in Las Vegas the same night as her wedding, and after seeing the social media campaign, he decided to make a stop at the wedding. He made her dreams come true by walking her down the aisle to her new husband. The chapel held a lot of significance to him as well, as it was the same chapel that he married his wife in 1989.</p><h2 id=david-harbour><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>David Harbour</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>David Harbour</a> went above and beyond for one of his fans. She tweeted him asking if he would <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">take senior photos with her</a>. He told her he would do it if the tweet got 25,000 retweets. Of course, the internet did its thing, and she got all of the retweets plus more. Of course, he followed up on his promise and took senior photos with her, where he also wore a sweatshirt with the school's name on it, and he also held a trombone. The pictures from the shoot were epic, and it will definitely go down as one of the coolest things a celebrity has ever done for a fan, hands down.</p><h2 id=shaquille-o-neal><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Shaquille O'Neal</span></h2><p><a href=#>Shaquille O'Neal</a> went the extra mile for a fan recently. He was shopping in Atlanta when he walked into a jewelry store. Inside, a man was buying an engagement ring. He wanted the ring, of course, but couldn't afford it as he was asking how much it would be to pay it off. Shaq stepped in, where he offered to <a href=#>pay for the ring</a> for him. At first, he didn't want to take Shaq's money, but he insisted, as he's always striving to do something good for other people every time he goes out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>5 Celebs Who Adore Their Fans (& 5 Who Aren't Very Nice)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKR6qa3VnmSgp56aeqKuzq%2BcZpmemXqjsdiopZ1llqS%2Fbq2Mn5inZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./red-shoes-trending-fall-zappos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Red Hot Shoes Currently Trending for Fall</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zugey-lamela-bio-wiki-edad-altura-padres-boda-esposo-telemundo-wikipedia-twitter-salario-y-patrimonio-neto.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zugey Lamela Bio, Wiki, edad, altura, padres, boda, esposo, Telemundo, Wikipedia, Twitter, salario y</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

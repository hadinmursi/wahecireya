I was like, ‘Really?’ [They said], ‘You’re my favorite actor around right now. You’re my favorite actor.’”</p><p>Faison confessed that he asked his youngest children, son Rocco, 10, and daughter Wilder, 8, whom he shares with wife<strong> CaCee Cobb</strong>, if he was a “better” actor than <strong>Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</strong>. And they replied, “Way better than The Rock.’”</p><p>After receiving praise from his kids, Faison shared he felt “real good” especially since Extended Family was one of the few projects of his they’ve seen.</p><p>“They’ve never seen Scrubs,” he told Us. “My daughter recently watched <a href=#>Clueless</a>, but I don’t think she remembers it. If we were to put it on again, she’d be like, I don’t know. And they’ve seen <a href=#>Remember The Titans</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Donald-Faison-Says-His-Kids-Told-Him-He-s-Their-Favorite-Actor-After-Watching-Extended-Family-798.jpg><p><span>Donald Faison.</span></p><p>In addition to Rocco and Wilder, Faison is also the father of son Kobe, 22, and twins Dade and Kaya, both 24, whom he welcomed with late ex-wife <strong>Lisa Askey</strong>. He also shares son Sean, 26, with ex <strong>Audrey Ince</strong>.</p><p>While Faison is happy to have his children’s approval for Extended Family, the best part of working on the comedy was getting to work alongside <strong>Jon Cryer</strong>. The sitcom follows Cryer’s character, Jim, as he and ex-wife Julia (played by <strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>) navigate coparenting as his ex moves on with her new fiancé, Trey, portrayed by Faison.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Donald-Faison-Says-His-Kids-Told-Him-He-s-Their-Favorite-Actor-After-Watching-Extended-Family-797.jpg><p>“Working with Jon Cryer has been a dream of mine actually,” he gushed about his costar. “And certain things in Hollywood, you don’t expect to happen.”</p><p>Faison shared he was a big fan of Cryer, 58, and Pretty In Pink was one of Faison’s favorite movies. He confessed that Cryer’s character in the ’80s romcom was an inspiration for him as a teenager.</p><p>“I wanted to be Ducky. If you look at any photos of me in high school, I dressed just like Ducky and Dwayne Wayne from a different world,” he teased. “So you combine those two, you combine Jon Cryer and <strong>Kadeem Hardison</strong>. You got Donald Faison in high school.”</p><p>Faison revealed that when he first met Cryer on set, he was starstruck after the actor approached him.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He came up to me and was like, I love your work,” he shared while reenacting his fangirl reaction. “But now I try every way I possibly can to get a laugh from him because he’s my work buddy.”</p><p>Extended Family airs on NBC on Tuesdays at 8:30 pm ET and is available to stream on Peacock the next day.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuoppGhsW6ywKKqqKajYriqsNJmq6iklGK1qrmMoZysZaSdsqq%2BjJ%2BYr6einsGmecCcq6iqXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./donnie-wahlberg-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me-2014105.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Donnie Wahlberg: 25 Things You Don't Know About Me</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./benicio-del-toro-net-worth-parents-disappointed-he-didnt-become-a-lawyer.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Despite Being Worth $45 Million From His Acting Career, Benicio Del Toro's Parents Were Disappointed</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

It was the first time since the start of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Attitude Era</a> that WWE didn’t have Rock and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Austin</a> at the top of the card.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>WWE losing two iconic superstars was hard, especially since Rock was still in his prime as the biggest star in the wrestling industry.</p><p>Rock has revealed more information about what went into his planning to say farewell to wrestling for a new chapter in acting.</p><p>The gamble obviously paid off with Rock becoming a massive superstar today, but it was a tougher decision at the time. Find out more about his thinking with some reasons for Rock leaving WWE in 2004.</p><h2 id=honored-his-wwe-contract><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Honored his WWE contract</span></h2><p>The Rock <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made it clear</a> he wasn’t going to leave WWE until his contract expired as a talent. WWE had Rock under contract until 2004 and allowed him to shoot movies at his own pace. Once the contract ended, Rock decided to leave the industry for a while to start his new chapter knowing his wrestling tenure closed the right way.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Things Dwayne The Rock Johnson Does To Stay In Shape</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wanted-a-new-challenge><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Wanted a new challenge</span></h2><p>The Rock is clearly a very driven person that likes to accomplish his goals. Acting was an industry few athletes could ever even make the jump into. Rock believed he could do a great job if the roles were offered to him. The challenge of thriving in a bigger form of entertainment was a motivating factor for Rock.</p><h2 id=the-mummy-returns-changed-his-life><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>The Mummy Returns changed his life</span></h2><p>The Mummy franchise was quite popular when The Rock received a huge role as the Scorpio King character in The Mummy Returns sequel. Brendan Frasier was the star of the franchise, but the hope was that Rock would add another element of star power during his peak in WWE. The movie was a huge success and made Rock realize he could get consistent noteworthy roles.</p><h2 id=wwe-would-always-welcome-him-back><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>WWE would always welcome him back</span></h2><p>The decision to leave WWE didn’t necessarily mean The Rock had to leave the industry forever. Rock knew his importance to WWE and family legacy in the business would always make him a valuable entity. Even if the acting career suffered, Rock could always come back and have new programs after a break. The success saw Rock’s return come later than expected all the way in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wanted-to-make-his-family-proud><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Wanted to make his family proud</span></h2><p>The Rock is quite open about the factor of making his family proud in everything he does. WWE giving him the chance at wrestling as a third-generation star inspired him to take his family legacy to the next level. A new start in acting gave him the chance to break out on an even bigger level to show more love to his family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Pics Of Dwayne Johnson And His Kids Proving The Rock Is Total Dad Goals</a></span></p><h2 id=it-helped-the-wrestling-industry><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>It helped the wrestling industry</span></h2><p>Many fans thought The Rock leaving WWE would hurt the business since he was such a huge star, but it did the opposite. Rock proved that wrestlers could make the jump to Hollywood. Past stories of talents like Hulk Hogan flopping made it unlikely for the transition to work out. However, Rock’s success helped get opportunities for talents like Batista and John Cena.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=couldn-t-accomplish-anything-more-in-wrestling><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Couldn't accomplish anything more in wrestling</span></h2><p>The Rock left WWE at his peak and a relatively young age due to already accomplishing everything possible. WWE witnessed Rock become the face of the company, have world title reigns, and WrestleMania classics. Rock needed to do something new since there was nothing left for him to prove in WWE.</p><h2 id=starring-roles-came-his-way><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Starring roles came his way</span></h2><p>2004 was around the time The Rock started to become a relatively consistent leading actor in movies. Roles in films like The Rundown, Walking Tall and Be Cool showed Rock would get the opportunities to prove his talent. The timing made it the right moment to leave WWE and take advantage of the momentum or it may never come again.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Rock's 10 Best Movie Roles (And 5 He Should've Rejected)</a></span></p><h2 id=created-business-relationship-with-vince><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Created business relationship with Vince</span></h2><p>The Rock and Vince McMahon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created a deep bond</a> with the family history and both men making huge money for the other. McMahon received a sweet deal with Rock during his first few films with an executive producer credit. The arrangement made Rock’s departure a less bitter pill to swallow for Vince.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-brand-split><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The brand split</span></h2><p>WWE moving forward with the brand split made it a better place for new stars to get opportunities. However, someone like The Rock didn’t necessarily benefit from having to reside on one show over the other. Rock’s schedule was hard to predict, and the brand split added another variable that made it less ideal for him to continue coming back for WWE programs on different brands each time.</p><h2 id=fellow-legends-retired><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Fellow legends retired</span></h2><p>WWE was already experiencing a major change with other legends of the Attitude Era retiring. The Rock wasn’t the first retirement as Steve Austin and Mick Foley retired from the ring. Foley made occasional appearances, but he was no longer an active wrestler. Rock was just the next of his era to hang up the boots from the full-time run.</p><h2 id=wanted-a-quiet-farewell><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Wanted a quiet farewell</span></h2><p>The Rock never wanted to have a huge farewell storyline to write him off television. One reason was the desire to eventually come back in the future when it made sense. Rock was allowed to leave without making it a big announcement. Even the last few matches of Rock in the 2010s saw him quietly leaving without providing clarification on a retirement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=put-over-new-stars><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Put over new stars</span></h2><p>The Rock did his best to help put over new stars for WWE in his final appearances before leaving for good in 2004. Brock Lesnar and Goldberg each scored massive victories over Rock to help cement them as top WWE stars. Even Rock’s last 2004 match saw him and Mick Foley losing to Evolution with Randy Orton and Batista benefiting immensely. Most wrestlers want to leave after putting over others, and Rock did just that for ideal closure.</p><p>Sources: Wrestling Observer, PW Torch, WWE Network</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>20 Heartwarming Facts About The Rock</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmq6GdXae8pLeMnZycoZSasW7Azmajnpmmmnq1tMRmrqudo6m5qrrGZqCnnKWowbPFjKKlZmpgZYFw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hew-moran-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-613251-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hew Moran Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./felix-jones.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Felix Jones Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

The Chicks are as famous for their political views as they are for songs like "Landslide." Like <a href=#><strong>Dolly Parton</strong></a>, the Chicks members speak their minds about what matters to them. They don't seem to mind if people disagree with them, which is admirable.</p><p>At the end of December 2023, Laura Lynch, one of the founding members of the Chicks, tragically died. Since she was part of the popular band for a little while, fans are curious about who received the money that she left behind.</p><h2 id=the-chicks-founding-member-laura-lynch-39-s-family-likely-inherited-her-estate>The Chicks Founding Member Laura Lynch's Family Likely Inherited Her Estate</h2><p>While there has been no official confirmation, Laura Lynch likely left her money to her <strong>husband, Mac Tull, and their daughter, Asia</strong>. Since Lynch's cousin Mick Lynch is the one who shared the sad news of her passing with media outlets, it's possible that they were close and she left him some money as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dixie-chicks.jpg><p><strong>Laura Lynch's net worth is unknown</strong>. But since she was part of the Dixie Chicks when they first began making music, it seems likely that she made some good money. The Chicks are some of <a href=#>the wealthiest country musicians</a>, and according to Fox Business, their <strong>net worth is $150 million</strong>.</p><p>If someone prepares for their death and sets up a will and trust, then it's easier for their relatives to deal with the question of who inherits their estate afterward. According to Willfill.co, sometimes things don't work out quite that easily. For example, when Anna Nicole Smith passed away, Daniel, her child, inherited her estate. But her daughter, Dannielynn, wasn't included in the will since Smith didn't mention what would happen if she had more kids. However, in the case of Laura Lynch, she had one child. It seems likely that her will and estate were straightforward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/who-inherited-chicks-member-laura-lynch-s-huge-estate-after-the-musician-s-sudden-death_-the-chiks-_youtube.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/why-maren-morris-husband-net-worth-rivals-her-own.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Maren Morris' Battle With Country Music Goes Deeper Than Being Called 'Not Country Enough'</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Maren Morris is a popular country music singer, but she has been vocal about issues she has with the music industry.</span><p>Forbes also reported that sometimes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stars's estates become complicated</a>.

Laura had a gift for design, a love of all things Texas and was instrumental in the early success of the band.

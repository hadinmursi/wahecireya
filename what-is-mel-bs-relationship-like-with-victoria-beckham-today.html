She has made it abundantly clear that her Spice Girls days are over. She was not a part of their reunion tour in 2019, and&nbsp;it doesn't look like she'll be jumping to join the rest of the Spice family when they make their rumored sequel to Spice World&nbsp;The Movie either.</p><p>She'll<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;never rejoin the Spice Girls ever again</a>, sadly. She seems more preoccupied with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">watching her family</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her successful business adventures</a> grow. But that doesn't mean her fellow Spice sisters hate her for bailing on them. Mel B and the rest of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the iconic '90s girl group</a> understand... kind of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beckham-chose-to-sit-out-the-reunion-tour-and-there-was-drama>Beckham&nbsp;Chose To Sit Out The Reunion Tour, And There Was Drama</h2><p>The last time all of the Spice Girls performed together was at the London Olympics in 2012. According to Mel C, Beckham had severe stage fright before riding onto the stage. So that might be one of the many reasons why Beckham chose to opt-out of the 13-date Spice World – 2019 Tour.</p><p>There was tons of confusion and drama before the tour even started.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mel C Says The 'Spice Girls' Were Never Sexually Harassed, And Here's Why</a></span></p><p>In 2018, Mel B told the British morning show Loose Women&nbsp;that the group would reunite. "For sure, we are getting back together," she said. "There's one that's been a bit difficult. But I'm hoping she's going to get roped in." That one being Beckham. By then, there were already rumors that she wouldn't show.</p><p>When Mel B said this, Beckham was reportedly not best pleased. According to&nbsp;The Sun's Bizarre column, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beckham was infuriated by Mel B's promises of a reunion.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Victoria was always up for a catch-up and the prospect of a celebration of the band's work, but going out on the road for concerts was never something she agreed to," a source told the publication. They continued to say that every time Mel makes a promise, she's seen as the "killjoy" who's trying to stop it from happening.&nbsp;Beckham didn't like Mel B giving fans false hope that all of them would reunite and that she&nbsp;told the other girls "to make Mel calm down in her public announcements."</p><p>The Sun also&nbsp;implied that Beckham and Mel B hadn't seen each other since they met with their original manager, Simon Fuller, that February.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria Beckham Is The Richest Spice Girl, But How Much Are The Other Members Worth?</a></span></p><p>"Their relationship is in a bad place. Victoria and her team see Mel as a loose cannon, who just says anything about the Spices, true or not, to get attention," the source claimed. "The problem is that anything that is talked about in private could go public by Mel — and that can be problematic."</p><p>Mel B also told&nbsp;Hoda Kotb that Beckham "always" denies a Spice Girls reunion. "She’s always saying that. Stop it. We are touring. Should I have really said that out loud? Yes, we are going to be doing performances together for sure," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That same year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beckham was also allegedly&nbsp;furious at her fellow Spice sister</a> for revealing certain things in her autobiography, Brutally Honest. "The girls are very much like sisters. They bicker, they fall out, and they make up," a source told Now magazine.</p>By then, Beckham had announced via her Instagram that she would not be joining the tour. "I won’t be joining the girls on stage again, but being in the Spice Girls was a hugely important part of my life, and I wish them so much love and fun as they go back on tour next year," she wrote.According to InTouch , Mel B was not happy about her decision at all.<h2>After The Tour, Mel B Was Disappointed At Beckham</h2>Following the Spice Girls performance at Wembley Stadium, Mel B told Good Morning Britain that she was disappointed that Beckham didn't show at the performance."I expected her to come and just say hi at least. Not even on stage, just as an audience member supporting. I’m sure she has her reasons for not. I’ve already said, ‘yeah, I was upset’ I still am a little bit. It is what it is, and us girls, we all support each other no matter what, but yeah, it is disappointing," she said. <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mel B said it wouldn't come between them, however.&nbsp;"No, we’re all adults; we all have to respectfully get on with whatever. But it is a bit disappointing, let’s put it that way."</p><p>In&nbsp;2020, Mel B said she was hopeful that Beckham would change her mind about joining them in the future, however. "Us girls, we still talk. We have our phones. We talk about opportunities. I like to think in the future there will definitely be more Spice shows."</p><p>Now maybe Beckham's time because there might be a Spice World The Movie sequel in the works to commemorate the first film's 25th anniversary. Yet, Beckham has let on that she knows nothing about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mel B To Victoria Beckham: Here's What The Spice Girls Are Up To, In 15 Pics</a></span></p><p>The Sun reported in early May that the group's already talked to a screenwriter about a possible "tongue in cheek" sequel, and they're all on board. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mel B and the rest of the girls are reportedly bombarding Beckham to join them</a>, even if it's&nbsp;for a small cameo.</p><p>Sources say that Beckham hasn't said no yet and that the girls could persuade her into reuniting with the gang. We're praying she has a change of heart about closing off the Spice Girls and that part of her life for good. It could very possibly erase any drama that she seems to&nbsp;have with Mel B as well. They'll always be sisters. But we need Beckham in this sequel.

He joked: “I’ve won the <a href=#>Most Villainous Guy on TV</a> [award] twice. I’m so proud of that. Sure, we’ve won a few <a href=#>Emmys</a>, but winning the award as the Most Hated Man, that’s hard to do. I’m so proud of it.”</p><p>Before Shark Tank’s premiere in 2009, he and costar <a href=#><strong>Robert Herjavec</strong></a> worked together on the show’s U.K. counterpart, Dragon’s Den. Just like O’Leary, Herjavec, 61, was contacted by Burnett, 63, to join the series — only on much shorter notice.</p><p>“They were already starting to shoot and they had somebody else that was going to be me — somebody who was actually pretty famous, we can’t say — and then it didn’t work out,” the <a href=#>Canadian businessman</a> explained to Us. “So, Mark called me. I was actually skiing, and he said, ‘We’re doing this show called Shark Tank with Kevin. You should come and do it.’ And I said, ‘Great. Where do you shoot?’ He said, ‘California. Can you be here by tomorrow?’ And we got a visa in 24 hours. It was incredible.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kevin-O-Leary-Says-He-Was-Cast-on-Shark-Tank-For-Being-an-A-Hole-1.jpg><p>Despite his previous experience on Dragon’s Den, Herjavec thought Shark Tank would be a “hard concept to get off the ground” for American audiences. “In the first season, I remember we had dinner and we were all like, ‘Wow, that was great. We’ll never see you again,’” she shared.</p><p>O’Leary agreed, adding, “The premise was for reality TV, if you got five years, that was a huge run. And for the first few years it struggled, but then it captured the imagination of everybody that had inspiration to be an entrepreneur in America, and that’s everybody.”</p><p>Now 15 seasons in, the show’s success “surprised everybody involved in it,” according to O’Leary. “It became a family show at the same time, it went geometric in its fourth year and we’ve never looked back,” he added.</p><p>The pair have grown close with their fellow Sharks <a href=#><strong>Daymond John</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Barbara Corcoran</strong></a>, <strong>Mark Cuban</strong> and <strong>Lori Greiner</strong> over the years, so much so that they aren’t afraid to <a href=#>poke fun at each other</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kevin-O-Leary-Says-He-Was-Cast-on-Shark-Tank-For-Being-an-A-Hole-2.jpg><p>“We’ve been working together for 15 years and I will say this — and this just shows you how much we like each other — I buy [Barbara] a new broom every year so she can make it to California,” O’Leary quipped, to which Herjavec replied, “You’re so mean to her.”</p><p>O’Leary, for his part, stated that he’s “not mean at all,” before stating, “I think of her like my great-grandmother, very lovingly.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Shark Tank season 15 premieres on ABC Friday, September 29, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKerpmjerC4xJqpsmWZqHqxvs6um2asmJbBbr%2FHmqmkZaSWu6x5wpqqrWWYnrpuwM5mmZ5lkaN6onnHqKOeZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lillian-solange-beaudoin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lillian Solange Beaudoin</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kelly-clarksons-friends-push-date-again-finally-get-over-divorce.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kelly Clarksons Friends Push Her To Date Again So She Can Finally Get Over Her Divorce</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

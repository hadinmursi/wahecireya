She got divorced, started a new relationship, released an amazing album, and has been playing non-stop in Las Vegas for over a year now. Her new relationship and the chapter of her career that opened with the release of 30 led her to make new decisions in her life. For years, she has struggled with stage fright, but has been steadily rebuilding her confidence. She has also been taking care of her health properly, and is very happy with the results.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ttweb_how-adele-almost-lost-all-her-net-worth-after-divorcing-ex-husband-and-what-she-learnt-from-it_bk_a1_v2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Adele Lost Millions After Divorcing Her Ex-Husband, But Things Are Different With Her Second Marriage</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Adele's marriage with Simon Konecki ended without a prenup and ended up costing the singer a fortune.</span><p>But now, what all fans are wondering: does this mean there will be new Adele music out in the world? Well, there will be... just not for a while. Recently, the singer opened up about her plans for the future, and while she definitely won't be quitting music any time soon, it might be some time until she's ready to release a new album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adele-is-finishing-a-long-vegas-residency>Adele Is Finishing A Long Vegas Residency</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/adele-singing-brit-awards-2022.jpg><p>It's been a couple of years since Adele last released music. Her most recent album, 30, came out in 2021, and she hasn't referred to any upcoming releases since then. In November 2022, she began her residency in The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and while it was only supposed to last a year, she enjoyed the experience so much she decided to extend it. This was in place of the promotional tour that would ordinarily follow the release of a new album, and it also helped the singer cope with her issues with stage fright.</p><p>"This residency, these shows have changed my life," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said sincerely</a>. "I desperately needed to fall back in love with performing live again, and I have. I needed to reconnect with my songs and remember what they mean to me, and I have!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that the extension of her residency is approaching its end (the last show will be in June 2024), questions about her future have been popping up. She recently opened up about what the next step in her career will hold, but sadly, it won't be new music. At least not for a while.</p><h2 id=adele-spoke-candidly-about-her-future>Adele Spoke Candidly About Her Future</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/adele-graham-norton-show.jpg><p>Right now, Adele is probably at one of the highest points in both her career and her personal life. She has been steadily working on herself, both as a singer and a person in general, taking care of herself, her partner, and prioritizing her comfort and health. Recently, she shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she had gotten completely sober</a> after having a complicated relationship with alcohol most of her life. It was due to her health mostly, but also because <a href=#>her relationship with Rich Paul was suffering</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/adele-at-the-brit-awards-2022-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Adele's Net Worth Is So Massive, A $60 Million Mansion Is Practically Pennies</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>She is one of the most popular entertainers on the planet, and comes with a pretty hefty net worth.</span><p>2024 will undoubtedly bring changes to Adele's life and career, with the end of over a year and a half of calling Vegas The Colosseum her musical home, but she's not scared of what's next. Now sober, in a loving relationship, and confident on stage again, she's ready to start a new chapter. Unfortunately for her fans, this new chapter won't bring any new releases. But the good thing Adele confirmed was that, although it won't be soon, she will definitely release new music in the future, and when she does, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she promised she would go on tour</a>. Fans around the world might have to wait a little bit, but now the knowledge that the new songs will be played live to a much broader audience, and that will make the wait more bearable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnZ2cmnqlsc2inKxlnprEbrnUrKCcZaOkvK95wKagnWWimr2wvtOsZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF2owqeyxKugp59f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-javor-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-62287-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alex Javor Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-g-sevani-bio-wiki-age-height-wife-family-now-movies-dancing-and-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adam G.

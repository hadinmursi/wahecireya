Now, as they navigate first-time parenthood, they’re realizing how little they actually know about each other. In this exclusive clip from the 16 and Pregnant season five premiere, Maddy, 17, and her baby daddy, 19, go on their first official date together — and end up arguing over how to raise their daughter.</p><p>Unfortunately for baby <strong>Aubrey Lynn</strong> — born on Oct. 20 of last year — things have only gotten worse since then. <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> caught up with Maddy before MTV’s Monday, April 14, premiere to get the scoop on her current relationship (or lack thereof) with Aubrey’s dad, who she says hasn’t seen his little girl in almost four months.</p><p>Asked about her pregnancy with Aubrey, Maddy told <strong>Us</strong>, “I think I was more terrified than anything else. Just because I knew my life was gonna change, I didn’t know how to tell my parents, and I knew I couldn’t support a baby by myself. It was worse because me and Cody didn’t know each other at all,” she added. “The first day we met was when I got pregnant.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=317 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="16 and pregnant maddy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Maddy claimed she was “basically on [her] own” the whole time. “He’d be out partying while I was at home crying my eyes out because I was so lonely and didn’t know what to do,” she told <strong>Us</strong>. “And then I finally talked to him about it, and I had a breakdown and he saw me cry in person, and then he started stepping up a little bit more and helping out…But then once [Aubrey] was born, he just stopped coming around.”</p><p>“He hasn’t seen her since she was 2 months old, or asked about her,” Maddy said. She claimed, too, that she’d reached out to his family to find out about allergies on their side, but has yet to hear back. (They did, however, transform their dining room into a bedroom and offer to take in Aubrey; Maddy turned them down.)</p><p>Luckily, she has a good support system in her own parents. Her dad, she told <strong>Us</strong>, is like a father to Aubrey, and she talks to her mom “like 13 times” daily. “We talk all day, constantly, so we’re still best friends,” Maddy said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That said, there’s definitely something missing. “I feel like it’s harder than I expected, just because I’m doing it on my own. And sometimes I feel like I’m on house arrest because I can’t go anywhere, really, ’cause I have her all the time,” Maddy told <strong>Us</strong>. “I love being a mom — I just feel like I want a family.”</p><p>The season five premiere of 16 and Pregnant airs Monday, April 14, at 10 p.m. ET/PT on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaGhvZZGjsW680Z6ep5meqXqxvsSmoJ6qlWLDqrDEqGSmmZSZxm60wKxkmmWSlq%2B6ecCfq56qXaS7pnnNop6hrF2owaK6w2ZpaWlkZoF1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./abel-tesfaye-ethnicity-is-he-ethiopian-646036-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Abel Tesfaye Ethnicity, Is He Ethiopian?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zack-fink-age-wikipedia-biography-family-salary-net-worth-instagram.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zack Fink Age, Wikipedia, Biography Family, Salary, Net Worth, Instagram</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

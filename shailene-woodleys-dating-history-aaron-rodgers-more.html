She did so via Instagram, posting a photo of the pair kissing. She and the rugby player were first linked in 2017. However, she revealed in April 2020 that they had split.</p><p>Us Weekly reported in February 2021 that Woodley was seeing Rodgers following <a href=#>his breakup</a> from <a href=#><strong>Danica Patrick</strong></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Aaron and Shailene are <a href=#>dating</a>!” a source told Us at the time. “They started off as friends, but things have turned romantic. The two are staying in contact while they are living away from each other. The relationship is long-distance for right now, but they are making it work.”</p><p>The Green Bay Packers quarterback then surprised fans days later when he announced that <a href=#>he “got engaged” in 2020</a>, giving a shout-out to his “fiancée.” He did not mention her by name, though. (Us confirmed in February 2022 that the <a href=#>pair called it quits</a>.)</p><p>Woodley’s apprehension to detail specifics about her relationships has not stopped her from speaking out about her views on dating. “I fall in love with human beings based on who they are, not based on what they do or what sex they are,” she told <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> in March 2014.</p><p>The <a href=#>Big Little Lies</a> alum expanded on the topic in March 2015, telling <a href=#>Elle</a> that she is “all-loving” and “heart-centered” in her approach. “When you’re truly in love, for me, it’s … you’re my lighthouse!” she said. “You’re somebody who holds me high, keeps me safe, you’ve got my f–kin’ back. … You also love me whole, wild and free. You let me do me, and I’m gonna let you do you! And I’ll be the home that you return to.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Woodley opened up in April 2020 about what she had learned about relationships as of late. “I clearly see that it’s important to sometimes slow down enough to understand the inner workings of your own heart and your own brain before you go looking for someone else to fill those gaps,” she told <a href=#>Parade.com</a>. “I don’t really want anyone to come into my life to fill a void. I want them to come into my life to add to what I’ve already been able to create.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to revisit Woodley’s complete dating history!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKmtyKWcp51drLywsMuesKxllJbBqrrGZp%2Biq6Skv7p5wJqpqKZdp7yls8Srqmaln6eycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./shimba-hills-green-safari-lodge-kwale-kenya.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shimba Hills Green Safari Lodge, Kwale, Kenya</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rithvik-dhanjani-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-550995-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rithvik Dhanjani Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

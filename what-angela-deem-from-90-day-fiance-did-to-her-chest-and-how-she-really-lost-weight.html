As a result of that, it has been long enough since the show premiered that <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé’s original stars can look back at their time on the show</a> in the proper perspective. Similarly, since 90 Day Fiancé has been on the air for so long, the show’s fans know that a lot of the show’s stars will never change on the inside even if they want to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Anfisa & Other Former '90 Day Fiance' Stars Do For A Living</a></span></p><p>When it comes to one of 90 Day Fiancé’s most talked-about stars, Angela Deem, it could easily be argued that she hasn’t matured emotionally during her time on the show. On the other end of the spectrum, there is no doubt that Deem has undergone a physical transformation since she first rose to fame. With that in mind, it begs a couple of obvious questions, what did Deem do to her chest and how did she lose so much weight?</p><h2 id=was-angela-deem-pressured-to-live-up-to-unrealistic-beauty-standards>Was Angela Deem Pressured To Live Up To Unrealistic Beauty Standards?</h2><p>In this day and age, it often seems like everyone has developed dreams of becoming famous someday. On the one hand, that makes perfect sense since being famous typically gives people a lot of advantages in life including money. However, there certainly is a dark side of fame, especially when it comes to women. For example, <a href=#>famous women often get body shamed</a> for supposedly not living up to a virtually unattainable beauty standard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘90 Day Fiancé’: Jess Caroline Finally Responds To Pregnancy Rumors In Powerful Speech</a></span></p><p>Sadly, even though the stars of <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé </a>are supposed to be regular people, some of them have been body shamed as well including Jess Caroline and Angela Deem. When it comes to Deem’s body transformation, if she is happy with the changes that she has made, that is all that matters. That said, it is still perfectly normal that 90 Day Fiancé fans are curious about how Deem has changed her body so dramatically.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-angela-deem-lost-so-much-weight>How Angela Deem Lost So Much Weight?</h2><p>Unfortunately, many people in the world struggle with their weight even though they would like to slim down. In most of those cases, those people don’t have access to some of the options that could help them make their desired changes to their bodies. After all, shows like My 600-lb Life have proven that there are some very effective options for people who want to transform their bodies but that they are very expensive.</p><p>Since Angela Deem first rose to fame, she has reportedly lost 90 pounds. When she has been asked about how she accomplished that feat, Deem has been very open about the fact that she received surgical help. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deem had five surgeries on the same day</a> including liposuction and having a gastric sleeve put in. When talking to US Weekly about the procedures she underwent, Deem revealed what inspired her to get the surgeries that changed her body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'90 Day Fiancé': What Has Angela Deem Said About Her Weight Loss Journey?</a></span></p><p>“I noticed when I went to Nigeria last time I was just putting on weight … I said, ‘I’m getting bigger or swollen.’ I mean, I think I gained 20, almost 25 pounds. It just hit me all at once. … I couldn’t even walk in the grocery store with the kids to get groceries. I was out of breath.” Once Deem came to that realization about her weight, she “really thought that [she] would die”. As a result, Deem concluded that she “needed something done” even though her kids were worried about the surgeries Angela underwent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-angela-deem-rsquo-s-chest>What Happened To Angela Deem’s Chest</h2><p>Ever since 90 Day Fiancé fans were introduced to Angela Deem during the show’s seventh season, she has easily been one of the show’s most controversial figures. With that in mind, it isn’t overly surprising that some 90 Day Fiancé are inclined to harshly judge everything about Deem. In reality, however, no matter what Deem has done in the past, it is admirable that she has been so open about how she has changed her body.</p><p>For anyone who wants to see proof of the fact that Angela Deem has been open about her body transformation, she allowed 90 Day Fiancé to film the aftermath of her breast reduction surgery. As a result, it is no secret that in the immediate aftermath of Deem’s breast reduction surgery, her man Michael Ilesanmi was upset with the results. Worse yet, Deem wasn’t happy at that time either and her doctor was largely responsible for that. The reason for that is Deem’s surgeon told her he would remove one pound from each of her breasts but took out twice that amount without her consent. As a result, some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">90 Day Fiancé viewers accused Deem’s doctor of malpractice</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'90 Day Fiancé': All Of Angela Deem's Biggest Controversies</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYq6vs8SlmGaclZq6brLRqKRmcWBisaLFjJ%2BgmqaTmnqltcNmq6hlmJq%2Fbq%2FHnqqtZZGjsW60zrBkrKCVYr%2BmrculsGakn6jBbsPEop6hrF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-be-called-a-wench.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What does it mean to be called a wench</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wayne-shorter-net-worth-jazz-saxophonist-legends-fortune-explored-amid-demise-at-89-588300-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wayne Shorter net worth: Jazz saxophonist legends fortune explored amid demise at 89</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

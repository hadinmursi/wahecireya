The music star, 40, likes to share her thoughts and feelings with the world - and this openness has only increased since the dissolution of her controversial legal conservatorship back in September last year. The "One More Time..." singer has been telling the world about just about everything - her joy at finding love again with fiancé (or husband?) Sam Ashgari, her excitement about having a new baby, and her relief at now being in control of her own destiny. This week, however, things seem to have accelerated to a whole new level of oversharing. Britney decided to share nude photos of herself with her 41 million Instagram followers, and the world at large. The 'photo dump', as she called it, has divided fans, and left many concerned for the vulnerable star's welfare.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Britney Spears Bares It All In New Photos">Britney Spears Bares It All In New Photos</a></span></p><p>So why have these risqué photos been upsetting Britney's fanbase? Read on to find out.</p><h2 id=what-did-britney-spears-do><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>What Did Britney Spears Do?</span></h2><p>In a series of three separate posts released yesterday, Britney shared nude photos of herself in a range of different poses - with her breasts and genitals covered by her hands and emojis. Along with the images, the singer shared what appeared to be confident, body-positive captions, which read:</p><p>'Photo dump of the last time I was in Mexico BEFORE there was a baby 👶🏼 inside me … why the heck do I look 10 years younger on vacation 🏖☀️ ??'</p><p>'I love you all SSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOO much 💋💋💋 !!!!'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And lastly: 'Don’t underestimate the power of doing it myself and shooting with a selfie stick 🤳🏻 !!!

Twitter was awash with users commenting on the revealing photos, and news outlets around the world picked up on the posts. The first group of images Britney shared have already amassed 1.2m likes on Instagram, and hundreds of thousands of comments.</p><p>Britney herself appeared unfazed by the reaction, and later posted a video of herself in a favorite dress performing catwalk poses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=many-britney-spears-fans-were-thrilled-with-the-photos><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Many Britney Spears Fans Were Thrilled With The Photos</span></h2><p>In the comments of her Instagram photos, many fans rushed to congratulate Britney - cheering her on.</p><p>'If this is what makes Britney feel free and gorgeous then that’s that + I support!!

Disappointing that some of her fans are giving positive feedback, encouraging these posts,' said another worried user.</p><h2 id=one-fan-suggested-britney-had-cheapened-herself><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>One Fan Suggested Britney Had Cheapened Herself</span></h2><p>One simply thought Britney had cheapened herself by sharing these images on Instagram: 'We love you Britney. Like from the bottom of our hearts. But, can you please stop doing this? You are BRITNEY F—KING SPEARS and you should be posing for magazines raking in millions for pics like these! This Instagram stuff is cheap and so beneath you.

With Sam liking one of the posts, many interpreted it as being complicit in the photo release.</p><p>'When will people start caring about Britney Spears? The look in her eyes always said it all. No matter how hard Sam Asghari, Instagram captions and Rosengart try to push for the "All Is Well" agenda, her eyes says something wrong is going on!' said BritneyIsNotFree.</p><p>One Instagram commenter theorized that Sam encouraged her to do this on purpose to help the cause for reinstating her conservatorship, explaining: 'Sam is the inside man for her family and everyone involved and he’s still drugging her making it seem like she needs to be in a conservatorship, and adding 'This is not a free woman to me. Someone should check on her.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One simply stated: 'The conservatorship made a lot of sense.'</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Britney Spears Gives Fans A Peek At Her Wedding Veil Ahead Of Nuptials To Sam Asghari">Britney Spears Gives Fans A Peek At Her Wedding Veil Ahead Of Nuptials To Sam Asghari</a></span></p><h2 id=but-many-defended-britney-spears-39-s-mindset><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>But Many Defended Britney Spears's Mindset</span></h2><p>In response to these many concerns, Twitter users came out in droves to defend Britney's photos. They claimed the snaps were both a sign of her happiness and independence, and also none of anybody else's business - accusing those concerned for her welfare of outright hypocrisy.</p><p>'Remember when Kim Kardashian posted a nude selfie & was praised for it but yet Britney Spears does it and she needs help? It's no wonder this poor girl has breakdowns. Why is she constantly held to a different standard? Let her do WTF she wants!' said one fan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>'Britney Spears fans can shut the hell up!

Arkhipchenko, 25, <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Nava in August 2020 after being separated for months.</p><p><a href=#>Nava was “open to looking for love,”</a> he exclusively told Us Weekly in April 2020. “I feel like love is the least of my priority list because I just have to get my life together and make sure I’m good as a person before I’m able to give somebody else something. I ended up finding out through the internet that she was with somebody else. That definitely hurt. It really broke my heart.”</p><p>The Russia native met someone else while her husband was <a href=#>serving nearly two years in prison</a> for marijuana possession. Nava felt “mentally and emotionally” stronger amid their split due to the “changes” he experienced while incarcerated.</p><p>The new dad<a href=#> lost 128 pounds in prison</a>. “I actually do a lot of the eating [from the food] that they do give us [in prison],” he told In Touch in April 2020. “But sometimes I do indulge [on the commissary items] and have a cheat day. … I actually started working out with other people that have been training and doing bodybuilding and stuff.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Arkhipchenko was “jealous” after his transformation, he told the outlet the time. “The news of my <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> didn’t sit with her very well. At that very moment in time, that’s when she blocked my phone calls and I kind of was starting to lose contact with her. She did tell me, like, right off the bat, the day after, that she didn’t want anything to do with me and that it was over.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/90-Day-Fiance-Jorge-Nava-Welcomes-His-First-Child-With-Girlfriend-02.jpg><p>Four months later, Nava revealed in his divorce petition that<a href=#> he weighs 185 pounds</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGZyaF2Zrrp5xaKYp5uVqHqru9GgnGamkauubsPEpZqopZWoenK%2F02aaoaGcmXq4tdOhZKChoqGzs7XEp5to</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-morrison-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-280030-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adam Morrison Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kirlyam-and-alan-cox-90-day-fiance-couple-gives-birth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>90 Day Fiance Duo Welcomes First Child!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

For some of us, it’s an accessory like a belt or stylish shoe. For others, it’s a certain lipstick or hairstyle. For Us, it’s a leather-look jacket. A great moto jacket can turn a basic ensemble into a high-fashion statement that belongs on the runway, and this one fits that description to a T! Plus, it’s 40% off right now!</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Rosa Biker Jacket by Topshop</a> is a wear-everywhere piece. Yes, really! We don’t need to be cruising down the highway or gathering at a bar with our motorcycle gang to wear it. We could be heading to work, taking advantage of bottomless drinks at brunch or meeting up with a date! Its versatility is endless and once we put it on, we’ll easily be able to see why.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Moto-Jacket.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Topshop Rosa Biker Jacket</a> (originally $88) for just<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"> $53</a> at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p>Shoppers were already floored by the price of this faux-leather jacket, so this sale is next level. One shopper called this jacket a “closet staple,” and another commented on its “amazing” quality, calling it “soft and comfortable” rather than tight and rigid. Many others noted how the textured material looks just like real leather, even though it’s totally vegan! One reviewer went into the versatility a bit, saying how they’ve been wearing it with “<a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> and boots” in the cold but “can’t wait to wear it in the spring with dresses!”</p><p>This jacket has all of the accents we’d hope for. In true biker-jacket style, it’s not shy about zipper details! It has an asymmetrical front zip closure, as well as zippered slant pockets at the side and zippers at the cuffs of the sleeves. Matching these zipper embellishments are two silver-toned buttons on the notched lapel.</p><p>Another classic moto detail is the quilting at the shoulders and the cuffs, forming a ribbed effect. Quilting isn’t only for our puffer jackets and our bedspreads! It can really help bring a jacket to life, and it majorly ups the fashion factor.</p><p>All of these details make <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">this jacket</a> edgy, but ultimately, it’s actually still quite feminine. It has princess seams, which are curved to follow our body shape and accentuate our waist for a flattering silhouette! This jacket blends biker-chic and princess vibes together to offer us the perfect mix of punk and pretty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Moto-Jacket-Back.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Topshop Rosa Biker Jacket</a> (originally $88) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$53</a> at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p>This faux-leather jacket hits right around the hip, so it’s not too long but also not cropped, making it great for everyday wear that can go with just about anything. Inside, we’ll find that it’s fully lined, making it not only durable, but also comfortable and easy to slip on and pull off, especially if we’re wearing it in the heat because we’re too stubborn to take it off. It’s that chic.</p><p>Topshop is a “global trendsetter” when it comes to street style, and this jacket is a prime example of why the brand is so popular. We can pair it with jeans of any cut, slacks, culottes, a skirt, a dress or a jumpsuit! We could pair it with a bathing suit too, if we wanted to. Why not? We’re not going to judge anyone’s personal style.</p><p>Need a little more outfit inspiration? We’re already brimming over with ideas. To keep it casual, we would pair this jacket with a pair of skinny or boyfriend jeans, a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> roll neck sweater</a> and a pair of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">extra comfy sneakers</a>. If we’re looking to dress it up a little bit, we can pair it with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">floral mididress</a>! Add a belt and a pair of flats or block heels and that’s all we need. A cute hat is also encouraged, but it’s whatever we’re feeling that day!</p><p>Nordstrom has price-matched <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">this moto jacket</a>, so we know we’re not going to get a better deal anywhere else. Only the best deal for the best jacket! This jacket runs a little small, but Nordstrom made it extra easy for us to choose a size that will fit us perfectly, noting in the size selection dropdown how each choice will fit. The easier the shopping experience, the better, so this is seriously the easiest choice we’ve made in a while!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Topshop Rosa Biker Jacket</a> (originally $88) for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">$53</a> at Nordstrom!</strong></p><p><strong>Not your style?

It was while filming the telenovela Niños Ricos, Pobres Padres that the coupe started developing feelings for each other, especially with all the romancing that their script demanded on set, they gradually hit it off in reality with one of the most unshakable commitments we have seen in the entertainment world so far.</p><p>Prior to their roles together, both Carmen Villalobos and Sebastian were committed to other people, on her own part, the telenovela star was involved in a 7-year long relationship but the name of her then-boyfriend was never publicized. Sebastian had been committed to another lady (name concealed) for five years prior to their meeting.</p><p>Sebastian was already single by the time they wrapped up the filming of the Telenovela and casually enquired about Carmen’s boyfriend, requesting for her to join him for a movie. And so their relationship took off from there. Though they always find themselves in different cities at different times, Sebastine constantly made out time to visit his lady love once every month.</p><p>Following their ten years of a successful relationship, Carmen Villalobos and her significant other decided to take their relationship to the next level after Sebastine popped the big question through a live call on the set of the reality television show popularly known as Exatlón Estados Unidos.</p><p>The couple officially got engaged in August 2018 and a few months later, by January 2019, Carmen Villalobos uploaded an Instagram post containing some of her dance move in a tale followed by her husband-to-be joining her!

The actress wasted no time in responding that her breasts only seemed big because of the type of bra she wore and not surgery.</p><h4><strong>Net Worth</strong></h4><p>Her annual income has never been reported but speculations are that the actress is worth around $3 million.

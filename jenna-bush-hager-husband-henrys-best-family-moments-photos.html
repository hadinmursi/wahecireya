W. Bush</a>, took office in January 1989 when they were just seven years old. The Massachusetts native served as the 41st president of the United States until January 1993. (George H.W. <a href=#>died in November 2018</a> at age 94.)</p><p>His granddaughters’ exploits became front-page news when his eldest son, <a href=#><strong>George W. Bush</strong></a>, ran for president in 2000. When he was sworn in as the 43rd President of the United States in 2001, Jenna and Barbara were already in college — but their lives remained in the limelight.</p><p>Jenna, for her part, also found love thanks to her father’s role as the head of state. She began dating husband <a href=#><strong>Henry Hager</strong></a> in 2004 while he was working on George W.’s reelection campaign in 2004.</p><p>“My worst first date involved the Secret Service, let’s just leave it at that,” Jenna told cohost <a href=#><strong>Hoda Kotb</strong></a> during a February 2021 episode of <a href=#>Today With Hoda and Jenna</a>. “It was with Henry and his car ran out of gas and went backwards and hit the Secret Service. … I was laughing, but he was horrified.”</p><p>The twosome overcame their disastrous first date and tied the knot in May 2008. The <a href=#>Sisters First: Stories from Our Wild and Wonderful Life coauthor</a> has since welcomed three children — Mila in April 2013, Poppy in August 2015 and Hal in August 2019 — with Henry.</p><p>“Last sunset of the decade that brought us these two beautiful girls and their baby brother,” Jenna <a href=#>wrote via Instagram in December 2019.</a> “How wonderful life is! Hoping 2020 brings you all the joy we get from watching the world through our babes’ eyes. 💫💫⭐️.”</p><p>Jenna later revealed how connected she is with <a href=#>her Today show costars</a> — and fellow moms — and how the TV personalities help one another parent at times.</p><p>“I am so lucky to work with this group of extraordinary moms. We all have kids who are similar ages so it’s been really fun and kind of wild,” she told <a href=#>Hello! magazine</a> in May 2022. “It’s great and I don’t take it lightly. Even this weekend when I was gone, I had one kid my husband had two, and<a href=#><strong> Savannah [Guthrie]</strong></a> picked up my kids and took them to church.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Wonderful World of Blue author added: “I’m so lucky to work with people who I not only adore, but I can lean on them. That’s the true meaning of sisterhood.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Jenna and Henry’s sweetest photos as a family over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a6zZpkm62jnXqprcaeqWagpaivorrDZp%2BepqKuwG6uxKyrZp6RoratxYympqadnqnAbrzHqKuoq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jim-bellinos-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jim Bellinos Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jelly-roll-siblings-and-family-678472-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jelly Roll | Siblings And Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

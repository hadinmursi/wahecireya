He was a top of the line creator of famous thrill rides and undercover work books. His original The Bird Has Landed (1975) sold in excess of 50 million duplicates and was adjusted into an effective 1976 film of a similar title. Higgins outstanding books are A Request for the Perishing (1973), The Hawk Has Flown (1991), Thunder Point (1993), Heavenly messenger of Death (1995), Trip of Falcons (1998), and Moment of retribution (2000).

He was born and brought up in Newcastle upon Tyne, Joined Realm. He was the child of an English dad and a Northern Irish mother. At the point when his dad deserted them soon subsequently, his mom got back with him to her old neighborhood of Belfast, Northern Ireland, to live with her mom and her granddad on the Shankill Street.</p><p>Higgins was raised in the midst of the strict and political savagery of Belfast, Patterson figured out how to peruse at three years old when he was entrusted with perusing The Christian Envoy to his laid up granddad. Around evening time, he would hunker underneath a window and read by the illumination of streetlights.</p><table><tbody readability=0.9171270718232><tr readability=1.1428571428571><td>Name</td><td><a href=# rel=noopener>Henry Patterson</a> (Jack Higgins)</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$86 million</td></tr><tr><td>Occupation</td><td>Author</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>175m</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>92 years (BD)</td></tr><tr><td>First wife</td><td>Amy Hewitt</td></tr><tr><td>Second wife</td><td>Denise Palmer</td></tr><tr><td>Cause of death</td><td>Not reported</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I read Oliver Bend when I was six. Not on the grounds that it was a work of art, but since it was a book that was accessible. I most likely didn’t figure out everything in that frame of mind for quite a long time I used to articulate the word maverick as rogger — yet I couldn’t have cared less. I simply adored perusing.</p><p>At the point when his mom remarried, the family moved to Leeds, West Yorkshire, Britain, where Patterson won a grant to go to Roundhay Language School for Young men. He ended up being an aloof understudy and left school with not many proper capabilities. In 1947 he started two years of public help, at first with the East Yorkshire Regiment, and later as a non-dispatched official of the Illustrious Pony Gatekeepers Regiment of the Family Cavalry accomplishing security work on the East German line.</p><p>Subsequent to leaving the military, he got back to schooling at Beckett Park educator trade school in Leeds and studied for a BSc human science certification as a London School of Financial matters outside understudy, taking his finals in Bradford in 1961. By day, he was functioning as a driver and worker around evening time. He picked the college for its “history of dissention”.</p><p>He accepted his second rate class degree following three years of review. Subsequent to getting a showing capability, he began educating at Allerton Grange Far reaching School. He acknowledged a task addressing in friendly brain science and criminal science He showed liberal studies at Leeds Polytechnic and training at James Graham School, which turned out to be important for Leeds Polytechnic in 1976.</p><p>Jack Higgins started composing books in 1959. One of his pseudonyms was James Graham. The developing progress of his initial work permitted him to put a hold on from his educating, which he quit in the long run to turn into a full-time writer. His initial books, utilizing his own name (as “Harry Patterson”) as well as the nom de plumes Graham, Martin Fallon, and Hugh Marlowe, are spine chillers that commonly highlight solidified, negative legends, merciless reprobates, and risky districts.</p><p>Patterson distributed 35 such books (some of the time three or four every year) somewhere in the range of 1959 and 1974, learning his art. East Of Destruction (1968), A Game For Legends (1970) and The Savage Day (1972) are striking among his initial work for their distinctively portrayed settings (Greenland, the Channel Islands, and Belfast, individually) and odd plots.</p><p>He started utilizing the nom de plume Higgins during the last part of the 1960s; his most memorable minor smash hits were distributed during the mid 1970s, two contemporary thrill rides The Savage Day and A Request for the Perishing, yet it was the distribution of his thirty-6th book, The Hawk Has Arrived, in 1975, that made Higgins’ standing. Its plot concerns a German commando unit sent into Engl and to capture Winston Churchill. The primary person is ostensibly an Irish shooter and artist, Liam Devlin.</p><p>Higgins followed The Hawk Has Arrived with a progression of thrill rides, including a few (Contact Satan, Confession booth, The Falcon Has Flown) highlighting the person Devlin. The third period of Patterson’s profession started with the distribution of Eye of the Tempest in 1992, a fictionalized retelling of a fruitless mortar assault on Head of the state John Major, by a savage youthful Irish shooter rationalist named Sean Dillon, employed by an Iraqi tycoon.</p><p>Give a role as the principal character for the following series of books (22 out of 43 distributed somewhere in the range of 1992 and 2017), it is obvious that Dillon is in numerous ways a mixture of Patterson’s past legends — Chavasse with his pizazz for dialects, Nick Mill operator’s knowledge of combative techniques and jazz console abilities, Simon Vaughan’s Irish roots, office with guns and the pessimism that accompanies taking on the obligation of managing an equity inaccessible through an enlightened general set of laws.</p><p>Jack Higgins’ ongoing spouse was Denise Palmer, they had their wedding in 1985. Notwithstanding, he met his most memorable spouse Amy Hewitt while both were learning at the London School of Financial matters. They were hitched in 1958, not long after he got a £75 advance for his most memorable novel — “the biggest wedding present we might have had.” Jack Higgins had four kids: Sarah Patterson (born 1960), Ruth Patterson (born 1962), Sean Patterson (born 1965), and H annah Patterson (born 1974).

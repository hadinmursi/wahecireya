She has several autoimmune conditions, including lupus, Sjogrën’s, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia and vasculitis. She also <a href=#>recovered from COVID-19</a> in December 2020.</p><p>Earlier this month, Inaba announced she’d return to DWTS, which was renewed for its 30th season. It isn’t known if this break will affect those plans or how long she plans to be absent from daytime TV.</p><p>“I appreciate your support,” she told fans. “I appreciate the love and support from The Talk family, and I hope to be back soon. Take care and I’ll keep you updated.”</p><p>Cohost <a href=#><strong>Sheryl Underwood</strong></a> addressed Inaba’s sudden exit during Monday’s show.</p><p>“Before we get started today, we’d like to let you all know at home, Carrie Ann is taking a leave of absence from the show to focus on her wellbeing,” Underwood, 57, said. “She appreciates the support from all of her fans and her family right here at&nbsp;The Talk. Carrie Ann, we miss you and we look forward to having you back with us soon.”</p><p>Inaba’s step back is very different from Osbourne’s recent departure from The Talk.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The British TV personality, 68, was let go after she came to <a href=#><strong>Piers Morgan</strong></a>’s defense during a tense conversation with her colleagues after he was accused of being racist. After the episode aired, other accusations were made against Osbourne, including that she <a href=#>used racist and homophobic slurs</a>&nbsp;toward former cohosts&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Julie Chen</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Sara Gilbert</strong></a>.</p><p>“The events of the March 10 broadcast were upsetting to everyone involved, including the audience watching at home. As part of our review, we concluded that Sharon’s behavior toward her cohosts during the March 10 episode did not align with our values for a respectful workplace. We also did not find any evidence that CBS executives orchestrated the discussion or blindsided any of the hosts,” the network said at the time. “At the same time, we acknowledge the network and studio teams, as well as the showrunners, are accountable for what happened during that broadcast as it was clear the cohosts were not properly prepared by the staff for a complex and sensitive discussion involving race.”</p><p>Osbourne <a href=#>denied any wrongdoing</a>. “I’m angry, I’m hurt,” the America’s Got Talent alum said on the April 16 episode of Real Time With Bill Maher. “I’ve been called so many things in my life … but a racist is one thing I will not take.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqaqqKesm6tzadkoqaRl65uw8eyZKKlXaGyosLIp55mrJiaerWty6Rm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cassie-randolph-is-dating-brighton-reinhardt-amid-colton-drama.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cassie Randolph Is Dating Brighton Reinhardt Amid Colton Drama</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brody-jo-hamilton-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-706392-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brody Jo Hamilton Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

His breakthrough came with the release of “Dumebi,” a track that catapulted him to fame, leaving fans worldwide grooving to his Afrobeat-infused rhythms.</p><p>In 2019, Rema made a significant move in his career by signing with Jonzing World Records, an independent record label owned by Nigerian music artist D’Prince. This pivotal moment marked the beginning of a musical journey that has captivated audiences and garnered Rema a dedicated fan base.</p><p>Among Rema’s notable contributions to the music world is the song “Calm Down.” This track, released on February 11, 2022, holds a special place in Rema’s discography, as it is part of his debut studio album, “Rave & Roses,” released the same year. “Calm Down” serves as the album’s second single and has resonated with fans for its catchy melodies and poignant lyrics.</p><p>Now, let’s address the question that has piqued the curiosity of many music enthusiasts: Is Rema’s “Calm Down” a nod to his Nigerian roots? The answer is a resounding yes. Rema proudly embraces his Nigerian nationality, and his music often reflects the rich and diverse musical landscape of his home country.</p><p>Nigeria, known for its vibrant music scene, has produced some of the world’s most influential artists, and Rema is undoubtedly a worthy addition to this esteemed lineage. His music draws inspiration from a multitude of genres, including Afrobeat, hip-hop, and R&B, creating a fusion that is uniquely Nigerian yet universally appealing.</p><p>As fans continue to enjoy Rema’s music and eagerly anticipate his future projects, one thing remains clear: Rema’s Nigerian heritage is an integral part of his identity and artistic expression. His journey from a young talent in Nigeria to an international music sensation is a testament to the power of music to transcend borders and connect people from all walks of life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqVoq5uusCtoKimkaG2tcWMoqpmqpWirm6vwKWkZpyfrLtuusignKuhkaN8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./richard-flood-bio-wiki-age-height-wife-movies-and-tv-shows-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Richard Flood Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Movies and Tv Shows and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pink-chooses-taylor-swift-or-katy-perry-w498406.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pink Chooses: Taylor Swift or Katy Perry?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

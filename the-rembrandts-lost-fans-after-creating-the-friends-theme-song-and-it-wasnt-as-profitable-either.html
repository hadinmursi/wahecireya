Prior to releasing the <strong><a href=#>Friends</a></strong> intro, the band was playing a completely different style. It seems like the band lost their identity once the track was released. However, on the flip side, they were also able to make some large profits because of it, and that can still be felt today.</p><p>We'll reveal what went on with the group's fame because of the song, and how it would cause The Rembrandts to split during the late '90s.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Producers On Friends Instantly Realized They Messed Up Bringing In Jean-Claude Van Damme Based On How He Was Memorizing His Lines</a></span></p><h2 id=the-rembrandts-had-a-completely-different-rock-style-prior-to-the-friends-theme-and-split-because-of-it>The Rembrandts Had A Completely Different Rock Style Prior To The Friends Theme, And Split Because Of It</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to releasing the Friends theme song, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rembrandts were headed in a different trajectory,</a> playing a darker rock version. However, things completely changed once the song got its release and popularity came with it. Suddenly, the band was playing in bigger venues, and had lost its allure of being an underground band, something they weren't ready for.</p><p>"We went from being the darlings of the alternative scene to a proper mainstream band," Danny Wilde tells The Independent.</p><p>"Before Friends we'd been playing all these underground venues. But 'I'll Be There' was so huge that we ended up playing stadiums almost overnight. We'd do these matinee shows and see 10-year-old kids in the crowd, singing along. When we were interviewed we were always asked how many claps there were in the song. I think we lost a lot of our original fans at that point, and many people stopped taking us seriously."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Bruce Willis Had A Strict Rule About Kissing Jennifer Aniston During His Friends Cameo</a></span></p><p>In addition, the group splitting up in 1999 was also blamed on the song and what it did to the group.</p><p>"You could say it became something of a curse, yes. We were tired of it being the only thing we were known for, and we were tired of being on the road. After the third album came out and did so well we toured for three years. We weren't writing any new songs and we weren't spending any time in the studio. The whole thing became a grind. There was no outright animosity between us, but we needed a break from each other."</p><p>Of course, there were benefits to creating such a massive hit and one of them was the profits that came with it.</p><h2 id=danny-wilde-revealed-the-salary-from-the-friends-theme-wasn-39-t-enough-to-retire-given-that-it-didn-39-t-come-with-publishing-royalties>Danny Wilde Revealed The Salary From The Friends Theme Wasn't Enough To Retire Given That It Didn't Come With Publishing Royalties</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fans-of-friends-believe-this-actor-played-a-different-character-on-the-show-before-landing-a-recurring-role.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Danny Wilde did reveal that he's grateful for the surge in popularity caused by the song, along with the profits the group was able to make. In terms of actual dollars, Wilde avoided given an exact figure, but he did reveal that the song turned him into a millionaire. These days, he hardly notices the royalties that come his way.</p><p>"To be honest I don't even notice it anymore," he said about the profits.</p><p>Nonetheless, although Wilde is grateful for the sum, he revealed that it isn't as much as most would assume.</p><p>"Well, let's just say I'm not going to retire on it, but I've managed to put both my kids through college. We get paid for performance, which means we make something every time it's on TV, but we never got publishing royalties."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Elle Macpherson Didn't Mind Her Kiss With Matt LeBlanc But Regretted Being On Friends</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wilde is also thankful for the fact that the song ensures that The Rembrandts won't be forgotten about any time soon thanks to their legacy on the show.</p><h2 id=r-e-m-was-initially-considered-to-write-the-friends-theme-song-but-they-turned-it-down>R.E.M.

The sitcom's showrunners showed interest in the group, while they wanted a song similar to the band's style.</p><p>Variety writes, “They wanted an upbeat tempo and used R.E.M. – I think it was ‘It’s the End of the World’ – to vibe off, then we replaced it with our own sound.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>R.E.M. ended up turning down the proposal, while The Rembrandts also hesitated with the offer at the start. After having a few drinks, they mustered up the energy to give things a try.</p><p>“But we’d hammered back a couple of beers, were getting loopy and decided to finish the next day. The following afternoon, they played us what we’d done, but had added claps. I went, ‘Okay. That’s the hook!’”</p><p>Before the group knew it, they had created a monster of a song and one that is still played on a loop today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7KurtGapZ2so2K5sL%2FTZp2apqNirqfAxKtknKqVlsGqusZmq6GdXZu%2FqrHNnapmrJiauqZ50qiloGWRo7FutdNmrpqrnql6or%2BMqamonpmprqO4xGacoqyYmr9w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./80s-stars-who-left-showbusiness.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>These '80s Stars Left Showbusiness For Good</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-bentist-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-210570-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Bentist Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

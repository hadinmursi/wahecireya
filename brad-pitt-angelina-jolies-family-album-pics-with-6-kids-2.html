Pitt then accompanied Jolie to Ethiopia in 2005 to adopt <a href=#>Zahara</a>, and he legally adopted both of her children the following year.</p><p>The Oscar winners went on to welcome <a href=#>Shiloh</a> together in 2006, and they adopted <a href=#>Pax</a> from Vietnam in 2007. One year later, Jolie gave birth to their twins, <a href=#>Knox</a> and <a href=#>Vivienne</a>.</p><p>Since the duo called it quits in September 2016, the Mr. and Mrs. Smith stars have been <a href=#>attempting to coparent their kids</a>. “Brad is enjoying spending more time with the kids and things have been improving with the four younger kids,” a source told Us Weekly exclusively in June 2019.</p><p>The insider went on to tell Us that the exes have been using OurFamilyWizard to make their dynamic work. “[That] has probably been one of the most beneficial tools for their family in terms of keeping things moving forward in the best amicable terms possible,” the source shared. “Once Brad and Angie began using the platform, it allowed them to coordinate the kids’ schedules. They have very busy lives.”</p><p>Jolie’s dad,<a href=#><strong> Jon Voight</strong></a>, gushed about what <a href=#>an “invested mom”</a> his daughter is in February 2019.</p><p>The Midnight Cowboy star told Us exclusively at the time: “She’s on it. She’s on it with these kids. She gives them love every second of their day. She’s very smart too. Smart girl. Brave. She’s got all these great qualities.”</p><p>Voight added, “Angie’s very good at encouraging the kids to be what they want to be, do what they want to do. … They’re encouraged to express themselves each in their own way.”</p><p>As for Pitt, the Fight Club star is “most excited” about fatherhood. “He encourages [his children] to pursue their hobbies. They do simple things like cook or watch movies,” an insider told Us exclusively of <a href=#>his parenting methods</a> in June 2019. “They love to hang out and talk. Brad talks to them about whatever is on their minds — he’s a great listener. He’s grateful that all the animosity is in the past. [The kids] come first. [He loves] being a dad and sharing his life with his children.”</p><p>The former couple’s relationship took a turn for the worse in October 2021 when <a href=#>Jolie sold her stake in their winery business</a>, Chateau Miraval. Four months later, a source told Us that <a href=#>Pitt felt the sale was done “just to punish him</a>. She did it to hurt him.” In February 2022, <a href=#>he sued his ex-wife for selling her shares behind his back</a>, claiming in court documents obtained by Us that Jolie was attempting to gain profits she didn’t earn. The Seven star also argued that the sale violated their agreement to only sell after obtaining mutual consent.</p><p>In June 2022, another insider told Us that <a href=#>the pair were still hammering out their custody agreement</a>, three years after they split.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite their ongoing legal battles, <a href=#>Pitt and Jolie are doing their best to remain supportive</a> of their children and their respective passions. “Brad and Angie are both very proud [of their kids],” a source told Us in June 2022.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Jolie and Pitt’s sweetest moments with Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkr7Otw2anoqykYq6vs8SloKeZXZ%2B8rbXErGSfmZ2eubp5wKWZrqVdpbakv4ywoK2gXWt6rLXDrGRrZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brad-stevens-age-wikipedia-biography-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brad Stevens Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./barbara-may-cameron-death-early-life-awards.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Barbara May Cameron Death, Early Life, Awards &amp;amp; Achievements</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

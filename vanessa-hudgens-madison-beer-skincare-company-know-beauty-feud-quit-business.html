Since then, Hudgens has branched out in her acting. She is the lead of the Netflix film series The Princess Switch, and she has also starred in productions such as Tick, Tick...

The celebrities wanted a more personal touch than what is typically found on the shelves, and they worked alongside dermatologist Karen Kagha.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Know Beauty differs from a lot of skincare companies due to its association with DNA analysis and the concept of personalized skincare.</p><p>Personalized skincare is a trend in the cosmetic industry that was particularly popular in 2021, which is when Know Beauty was launched. The idea is strong, as it not only provides information, but also theoretically a great skincare routine.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Customers are encouraged to use Know Beauty's DNA kit</a>, which they must purchase for not a low fee, and complete a short skin quiz.

Customers realized that a DNA sample is not really enough to determine exactly what their skin needs, and this is particular true for those with sensitive skin. Unfortunately for the trend, people with sensitive skin, either meaning reactive or acne prone, were the type of customers the trend was geared towards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the fall of personalized skincare, Know Beauty faced some issues.

Celebrity skincare and cosmetic brands are all the rage. Stars such as <strong><a href=#>Selena Gomez</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Hailey Bieber</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Rihanna</a></strong> have found great success with their cosmetic brands.</p><p>In an interview with WWD, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudgens opened up about the struggle she was having with the brand</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hudgens "had been trying to get customers acquainted with the brand for a while, but it just wasn't translating like we thought it would. After a year, we knew we needed to switch gears and try something different."</p><p>"Trying to take over an entire skin care line is a bit ambitious," Hudgens continued. "Instead I decided to focus on something specific that could easily be slotted into a skin care routine--something we can be known for."</p><p>Now, Know Beauty only sells their Glacial Bay Clay Mask, and customers can even purchase it directly on Amazon.</p><p>With the reboot of the brand, Beer thought that it was best to take a step back from the brand. She wanted to focus solely on her music career, especially with her new album coming out in late 2023. Restarting the entirety of Know Beauty was going to be too much work for her to take on.</p><p>Fans can rest easy knowing that there was no feud between Madison Beer and Vanessa Hudgens.

Swift's relatable lyrics about love and heartbreak are just two of the reasons why she has amassed such a large fanbase. Her audience is expected to grow even more with the release of her<strong> 11th studio album, 'The Tortured Poets Department'</strong>, <strong>which features 16 tracks and one bonus single</strong>.</p><p>Yahoo! News has revealed that Swift's new album is a definite nod to her ex-boyfriend of six years, Joe Alwyn, because he once admitted during an interview that he was in a <strong>WhatsApp group chat called the Tortured Man Club</strong>, which sounds a lot like Taylor Swift's album title.</p><p>While it may not surprise that Taylor Swift has drawn inspiration for her album from Alwyn, what has shocked many is that it appears to include songs <a href=#>related to her ex-boyfriend Matt Healy</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Matt Healy and Taylor Swift dated only a month</strong> after her shocking break-up with Joe Alwyn in early 2023. Healy, the lead front-man of the British rock band 1975 and the 'Shake It Off' singer, had a controversial relationship partly due to some of the former's questionable behavior.</p><p>According to a report in The Mary Sue, just one of <strong>Matt Healy's controversial moments </strong>came during a meet and greet with fans in which Healy mocked an Irish fan for her traditional name. This and other questionable behavior drew outrage from the media and Swifties, who believed Healy was not a suitable partner for Swift.</p><p>Despite the sensitive nature of their relationship, according to a report in TMZ, an alleged leaked lyric from one of Swift's songs refers to <strong>Matt Healy as a 'dog.'</strong></p><p>You smoked then ate seven bars of chocolate; we declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist.

Periodic tropical downpours will occur across the Southeast this evening through tomorrow (Monday). The best chance for flash flooding will occur in northern Georgia, upstate South Carolina, eastern Tennessee and western/central North Carolina on Monday</p><p>Late Monday into Tuesday, a cold front will push into the Southeast. Along the cold front, a line of showers and thunderstorms is possible, which could dump brief but heavy rain. Luckily, behind the cold front, drying will take place (see Fig. 2), which will briefly put an end to most shower and thunderstorm activity for a large part of the Southeast (other than coastal areas of the Carolinas/Georgia and Florida where heavy rain may lead to flooding</p><p>The drier air mass behind the cold front will be temporary. On Wednesday, a trough will push into the region (see Fig. 3) allowing a low to develop across northern Florida/southern Georgia. This low will intensify and lift northeast. This will pull Gulf moisture back into the Southeast (see Fig. 4) increasing rain chances for the Southeast Wednesday into Thursday. Some of this rain will be heavy, which will exacerbate the flooding issues in Georgia and the Carolinas on both Wednesday and early Thursday. Additional rain accumulations of 3-6″ are likely through Thursday for Florida, eastern Georgia, central and eastern South Carolina and much of North Carolina.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fmLWztdKtpqmglad6r8HNpZyyZZKevG6txp5kn5mdnrm6edKppq6rlWK7psCMsKarrJhiuqbAxKipqKSfnMZuwNaiq62domQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./750185-controversial-wwe-star-tops-pro-wrestling-illustrateds-top-500-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Controversial WWE Star Tops Pro Wrestling Illustrateds Top 500 List</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-bauers-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Bauers Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

No one could have predicted the huge success <strong><a href=#>The Big Bang Theory</a></strong> would go on to become. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">its pilot received so many negative responses</a>, that many aspects were reworked after the initial viewings. When it finally made it to the small screen, the show which embraced the nerd culture wasn’t an instant hit. However, by its second season, fans couldn’t wait to watch the social ineptitude of its geeky characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time the sitcom ended in 2019 after 279 episodes in its twelve-season run, it was a billion-dollar asset, and one of the most successful shows on TV.</p><h2 id=why-did-big-bang-theory-end>Why Did Big Bang Theory End?</h2><p>The decision to end TBBT wasn’t based on falling numbers, but rather on the decision of the actor who played Sheldon Cooper. Although there was a 13th season in the pipeline, <a href=#>Jim Parsons chose to leave the show, to pursue other ventures</a> beyond the sitcom genre.</p><p>Producers and the rest of the cast opted to end the series, rather than breaking up the strong ensemble. The belief was that it would be difficult to imagine any of the characters existing outside of the group.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The cast of TBBT was known for being close</a> and famously stood together during wage negotiations, which led to them each receiving close to $1 million per episode in later seasons.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Test Audience For The Big Bang Theory Hated A Main Character During The Original Pilot Screening</a></span></p><p>While the decision to stop the show at the end of Season 12 made sense to the actors and producers, the choice has never sat well with viewers, who were devastated when their favorite show came to an end.</p><p>In the years after the popular series ended, many fans have continued to ask why there has been no spinoff, other than the prequel, based on Sheldon’s childhood in Texas.</p><h2 id=many-diehard-tbbt-fans-don-rsquo-t-like-the-prequel>Many Diehard TBBT Fans Don’t Like The Prequel</h2><p>Hitting screens in 2017, Young Sheldon, which features Iain Armitage in the title role, is the only offshoot from the popular series. Although it’s followed in the parent show’s footsteps and become CBS’ second most popular comedy, fans of the original series have been critical of the offshoot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They cite <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many inconsistencies in the spinoff</a>, specifically around some of the storylines which had been set in the original series. They particularly have an issue with regard to Sheldon’s father, George, who was depicted as a bad parent in TBBT but portrayed very differently in the prequel.</p><h2 id=why-haven-39-t-there-been-other-big-bang-theory-spinoffs>Why Haven't There Been Other Big Bang Theory Spinoffs?</h2><p>Fans have wondered why there couldn’t be a spinoff featuring some of the other characters, particularly Raj, whose character they believe was undeveloped in the 12 seasons on TBBT. They’d also love to see a reboot featuring Howard, Bernadette, and their family. But producers are adamant there’ll be no sequels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show was created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, who were also executive producers. Interviewed after the show’s final wrap, Lorre spoke to TV Line. Asked about spinoffs, he answered that t<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he producers never seriously considered any character spinoffs</a>.</p><p>“Truthfully, the reason for a spinoff is economics, and that’s not the reason to do a show. You should do a show because you have something you really love, and you want to do it. Economics follow passion.”</p><h2 id=none-of-the-big-bang-storylines-could-continue-separately>None Of The Big Bang Storylines Could Continue Separately</h2><p>The creators believe that, given what happened in the final episode, it would be impossible to continue any of the storylines separately, as it was obvious the gang would continue to be friends. The series finale saw Sheldon and Amy winning the Nobel Prize in Physics, <a href=#>and Penny and Leonard announcing that they were expecting a baby</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Raj Was Kept Single During The Big Bang Theory Finale</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Quoted in the book, The Big Bang Theory: The Definitive, Inside Story of the Epic Hit Series, by Jessica Radloff, Producer Steve Holland had this to say on the subject about why there wasn't much attraction to the idea of a spinoff.</p><p>"I think we felt there was no winning with something like that. 'Big Bang' was this magical thing that we captured, and then to recapture it with any version of them that wasn't the whole cast wasn't something we really wanted to do," he said.</p><p>Both Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady believe that they created a perfect ending to a great series, and that it would be hard to come back to reopen the story after the closure they achieved.</p><p>Speaking to Explore Entertainment in September 2022, Lorre said: “I don't think we left anything undone.

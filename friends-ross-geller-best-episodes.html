Ross Geller is definitely one of the characters who fall into the muddled gray area. Fans either love him or hate him and there's no changing their mind. Still,<a href=#> the paleontologist who is hopelessly in love with his sister's best friend</a> did have some shining moments throughout the ten seasons that made even the naysayers appreciate Ross.</p><h2 id=the-one-where-ross-finds-out-season-2-episode-7><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>'The One Where Ross Finds Out' (Season 2, Episode 7)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-One-Where-Ross-Finds-Out.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Much of the buzz around&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;in the early years had to do with Ross and Rachel's will-they won't-they style relationship. The first season did an excellent job setting up that Ross still loved Rachel and this theme continued throughout the show.</p><p>During season 2, Ross and Rachel got their first chance to be together in the episode&nbsp;"The One Where Ross Finds Out." Ross finally got the kiss he'd been dreaming of after learning that Rachel had feelings for him when she called and left him a drunk message. The scene not only shows off Ross's softer side but it's also <a href=#>one of the best kisses of all time</a>.</p><h2 id=the-one-with-all-the-resolutions-season-5-episode-11><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>'The One With All The Resolutions' (Season 5, Episode 11)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-One-With-All-The-Resolutions.jpg><p>There's no denying that things weren't ever easy for Ross but most of the obstacles in his life were his own fault.

He begins this challenge by buying a pair of leather pants that he wears on his first date with Elizabeth which proves to be a mistake when he manages to get the pants down but not back up after a visit to the bathroom.</p><h2 id=the-one-with-the-cop-season-5-episode-16><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>'The One With The Cop' (Season 5, Episode 16)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-One-With-The-Cop.jpg><p>With so many characters, not everyone could be the star in every episode.

The California native made sure to bring the drama this season when she emerged as one of Dubrow’s biggest adversaries.</p><p class=x_MsoNormal>In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, Dubrow, 54, said Judge is “clearly” two-faced after watching this season. “She was saying one thing to my face, and another thing behind my back,” she explained.</p><p class=x_MsoNormal>The TV personality, who is married to plastic surgeon and Botched star <a href=#><strong>Terry Dubrow</strong></a>, added that she was especially bothered by Judge’s comments about Fireside Network — the&nbsp;interactive streaming platform founded by <strong>Falon Fatemi</strong> and <strong>Mark Cuban</strong>, which features Dubrow’s HD Network.</p><p class=x_MsoNormal>“We’re all women,” Dubrow emphasized about Judge’s comments on her work endeavors. “We need to support each other and each other’s businesses.”</p><p class=x_MsoNormal>However, Judge wasn’t the only costar that Dubrow was at odds with this season. Earlier this summer, <a href=#><strong>Shannon Beador</strong> </a>revealed that Dubrow was on her own in the ongoing drama with her castmates on RHOC. “I think at times [Heather] had people behind her but for the most part … she was on her own,” Beador, 59, exclusively told Us in June.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Heather-Dubrow-Says-Tamra-Judge-Was-Clearly-Two-Faced-On-This-Season-of-RHOC-284.jpg><p class=x_MsoNormal>In response to the disconnect between herself, Beador and the rest of the RHOC cast, Dubrow pointed out the ongoing narrative that she was trash-talking Beador’s ex, <a href=#><strong>John Janssen</strong></a>, and described herself as “the whipping boy” this season.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=x_MsoNormal>“Everyone’s saying, Heather’s saying it,” Dubrow told Us. “I want you to pay close attention tonight to conversations that <a href=#><strong>Emily [Simpson]</strong></a> has with Shannon and everyone has with each other, and you’ll see that that’s not true.”</p><p class=x_MsoNormal>Dubrow added, “I don’t think I understood in the moment how south everything was going,” the reality star admitted about her friendships. “And just when I thought it was safe to go back in the water, it was not. I don’t know, maybe I’m a moron.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp5OoeqmxwK2fnqpdmcKjvs6wZJ2Zqah6ta3Mq5hmoqWZtKZ51pqqZpucmq6zuNhmq7CnXZuupLHDaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ron-rivera-wife-stephanie-daughter-family-ethnicity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ron Rivera wife (Stephanie), daughter, family, ethnicity, net worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rachel-zoes-10-most-memorable-quotes-2011112.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rachel Zoe's 10 Most Memorable Quotes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

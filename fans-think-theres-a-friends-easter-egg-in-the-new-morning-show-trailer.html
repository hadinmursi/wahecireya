In the trailer for season two, the two actresses seemingly hint at their Friends characters in a passing reference.</p><h2 id=39-the-morning-show-39-season-two-trailer-includes-a-39-friends-39-reference>'The Morning Show' Season Two Trailer Includes A 'Friends' Reference</h2><p>In the trailer for the second season, UBA network honcho Cory (Billy Crudup, who won an Emmy for his performance in the role), goes to retrieve Alex from the snowy house at which she’s in exile.</p><p>“You are the only thing that can save us,” he begs, laughing at his own dramatic pronouncement.

The two start improvising, <a href=#>proving the sisterly, love-hate chemistry of their Friends days is still there</a>. Aniston and Witherspoon previously worked together as part of the legendary Green sisters trio — <a href=#>together with Dead To Me star Christina Applegate</a> — on the popular comedy.</p><p>The Morning Show debuted on AppleTv+ in November 2019 and consisted of a ten-episode season. An adaptation of Brian Stelter's book Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV, the series was developed before the #MeToo movement rose to prominence after the Harvey Weinstein scandal, but was reworked to include it in the storyline.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alongside Witherspoon and Aniston, who also serve as executive producers, the cast features the aforementioned Carell in a controversial role, Billy Crudup, Bel Powley, Mark Duplass, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw, among others.</p><p>AppleTV+ ordered two seasons of the show, for a total of twenty episodes. Production for the second series began at the end of February 2020 but was halted in March due to the Coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The Morning Show season two premieres on Apple TV+ on September 17</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Britney Spears Recreates Reese Witherspoon’s TBT Challenge In Nostalgia-Filled 2000s Reel</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYsGptc2kZK2glaeytHnAZp2roZWjsbR5xJqqrZ2iYrKos4yipWasmJp6r7HWZqSoqp6eu6h50qGmsGWkp66quMSrZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./geraldine-james-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Geraldine James Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./a-list-co-stars-who-are-best-friends-irl.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Famous Co-Stars Who Are Best Friends IRL</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

NYPD confirmed that a fight involving Brown and Drake’s entourages broke out at the club W.i.P., with five people sustaining minor injuries.</p><p>“He was on his way out of the club when the altercation began. He did not engage in any activity which resulted in injury to person or damage to property.”</p><p>“Forever” singer Brown, 23, Tweeted a photo of a deep cut on his chin after the incident, and wrote angrily, “How u party wit rich n**** that hate? Lol… Throwing bottles like girls? #shameonya!.”</p><p>VOTE: Celebrity feuds — whose side are you on?</p><p>“It was a huge fight,” an eyewitness at W.i.P., explaining that the actual brawl was between members of the&nbsp; stars’ crews rather than Brown and Drake themselves. Although Drake seemed “irked” by Brown, he exited the club without exchanging words with Brown.</p><p>“Chris and Drake never got in each other’s faces,” the observer continues, explaining that another bystander threw a bottle at Brown — leading to his injuries. “It was entourage versus entourage, never Drake versus Chris.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>But, indeed, there was major melee. “It was lot of pushing and shoving. People were picking up ice buckets in case they had to throw it. They tore the club apart. It was bad. People went to the hospital!”</p><p>(The pair weren’t the only VIPs at WiP on Wednesday night and Thursday morning: M<strong>ary J Blige, NeYo, Adrienne Bailon, Julissa Bermudez </strong>and<strong> Ashley Weatherspoon</strong> were partying nearby with <strong>Fabolous</strong> and <strong>Trey Songz</strong> earlier in the evening.</p><p>Many have speculated that the duo were sparring over <strong>Rihanna</strong>. The “We Found Love” singer has been secretly hooking up with volatile ex Brown for about a year — and is “good friends” with Drake, collaborating with him on the song and video for “Take Care.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadqpGgsm6wxKegnqtdlru6edarpqeflKS2r7OMoqVmm5intrR5waumsKZdm7aotNNmaWlpYmaBd3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./frances-tiafoes-wife-is-he-in-a-relationship-with-ayan-broomfield-342733-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Frances Tiafoes Wife: Is He In A Relationship With Ayan Broomfield?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./doug-stanhopes-eulogy-for-sean-rouse-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Doug Stanhope Remembers Sean Rouse, the Best Comedian Youve Never Heard Of</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

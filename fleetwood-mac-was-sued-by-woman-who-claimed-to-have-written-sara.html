According to the Washington Post, Hinton, a Michigan native, wrote a poem called "Sara" and submitted it to Warner Bros. for publication in November 1978.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stevie-nicks-msg.jpg><p>Fleetwood Mac released their double album Tusk in October 1979, and the second single from the album, also titled "Sara", was released two months later. Hinton noticed that there were a lot of similarities between her poem and Fleetwood Mac's song of the same name, and noted that the Tusk album had been released on the record label Warner Bros. Inc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At some point between December 1979 and May 1980, Hinton was able to get in touch with Fleetwood Mac songwriter Stevie Nicks, and discuss the fact that "Sara" the poem and the song were shockingly similar. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicks recounted the conversation, which happened over the phone</a>, during a Rolling Stone profile:</p><p>"There were some great similarities [in the lyrics], and I never said she didn’t write the words she wrote."</p><p>Hinton was unsatisfied with what Nicks had to say on the matter, so she decided to take legal action against Fleetwood Mac. <strong>She accused Nicks of stealing and repurposing the lyrics from her 1978 poem</strong>, and went as far as to suggest that the singer was able to gain access to the poem due to her connections at Warner Bros.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stevie-nicks-on-the-stage.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Stevie Nicks Was Left Furious After A Song About Lindsey Buckingham Was Cut From The Iconic Rumours Album</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>What has Stevie Nicks said about the emotionally charged song, 'Silver Springs'?</span><p>Hinton's lawsuit was filed in May 1980, and the court proceedings would continue until July 1981.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=carol-hinton-wanted-songwriting-royalties-after-39-sara-39-became-a-top-10-hit>Carol Hinton Wanted Songwriting Royalties After 'Sara' Became A Top 10 Hit</h2><p>The similarities between Carol Hinton's poem and Stevie Nicks' song are unmistakable, and this is something that Nicks was forced to acknowledge. There are <strong>several lines in the poem that are identical</strong> to the song's lyrics, with the most notable examples being:</p><p>- "Drowning in a sea of love"</p><p>- "When you build your house, call me"</p><p>The specificity of these words led many to assume that Hinton had a strong case. She was angling to <strong>claim songwriting royalties</strong> for "Sara", which had become a worldwide smash by 1980, peaking at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That being said, Nicks was not going to let someone lay claim to her song. She told Rolling Stone that she was not going to give up any of the royalties or songwriting credits to "Sara", and she'd rather pay out of her own pocket than be labeled a musical thief:</p><p>"[Hinton] picked the wrong songwriter. To call me a thief about my first love, my songs, that’s going too far."</p><p>Nicks had an ace in the hole: a demo recording of "Sara" that she made in July 1978, well before Hinton submitted her poem to Warner Bros. She also pointed to the differences in the subject matter between her song and Hinton's poem.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stevie-nicks-summer-fest.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Stevie Nicks Refuses To Play This One Tragic Song Live, And Fans Don't Blame Her</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Stevie Nicks discussed the deeper reason behind a song she rarely sings today.</span><p>In her 2014 autobiography, Stevie Nicks revealed that the song was <a href=#>inspired by an affair that her boyfriend at the time</a>, Fleetwood Mac drummer Mick Fleetwood, had with a woman named "Sara." The "Sara" in question was Nicks' best friend, Sara Recor.

Not only did she provide the aforementioned "Sara" demo dating back to July 1978, but she called upon the testimony of band members and fellow musicians <a href=#>like Eagles singer Don Henley</a> to confirm that they heard the demo shortly after it was made.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stevie-nicks-on-the-stage.png><p>Despite this evidence, the court case drew on. Nicks' attorney, Mickey Shapiro, told the Washington Post that the case was taking an emotional toll on the singer, and serving as a source of embarrassment given the pride she takes in her songwriting.</p><p>"Stevie feels very hurt by this. She sees her song as children. I think the case will be heard on its own merits."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It will never be made clear whether Nicks would have won the case outright, because she eventually decided to <strong>settle out of court with Hinton</strong>. She wanted to speed up the process, according to UPI Archives, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">agreed to pay Hinton $1500</a> out of her own pocket.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stevie-nicks-on-the-stage.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Stevie Nicks Missed An Opportunity With A Song That Became Blondie's Biggest Hit</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Giorgio Moroder wanted Stevie Nicks to sing the American Gigolo theme "Call Me," which became a No. 1 hit for Blondie.</span><p>When asked to explain how her song and Hinton's poem wound up being so similar, Nicks chalked it up to simple "karma." She also asserted that Hinton should not have accused her of stealing lyrics, as she could have done the same thing to Hinton given the time period in which she recorded the demo:</p><p>"Don’t tell me I didn’t write the words I wrote."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Sara" remains one of the most personal songs in Stevie Nicks' catalog, and she would even revisit the name, and the themes of the song, on the 1987 album cut "Welcome to the Room...

And I know there was stuff there that I wish we’d been able to deal with or talk about when you were younger.’ Because my parents were divorced. ‘I wish we’d had a chance to do that.’ And I said: ‘Oh, well, mom, what’s keeping us? Why don’t we do it?’”</p><p>During the April 13 episode of “<a href=# rel=noopener>We Can Do Hard Things</a>”, a podcast hosted by <strong>Glennon Doyle</strong>, her wife <strong>Abby Wambach</strong>, and her sister <strong>Amanda Doyle</strong>, Louis-Dreyfus had briefly touched on her family’s decision.</p><p>Expanding on the experience via her New York Times interview, Louis-Dreyfus added that “it was very, very helpful” and paved a new line of communication between the pair.</p><p>“It’s not like everything becomes perfect, but that’s not possible under any circumstances,” she told the outlet. “But it was an opportunity to communicate in maybe a more honest way, and in a safe way that was helpful to both of us. And I have no regrets about it. So if you’re thinking about it with your mom, and if you think your mother would be into it, I encourage you to do it, because you might not have the opportunity in 10 years, and you might think, Oh, if only.”</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Seinfeld</a> star also revealed that she sees her mother differently in light of their shared experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1052721254-Julia-Louis-Dreyfus-and-mother.jpg><p>The candid details comes as Louis-Dreyfus returns for season 2 of her award-winning podcast “<a href=# rel=noopener>Wiser Than Me</a>”, which sees the actress interview iconic older women — including her now 90-year-old mother.</p><p>Other guests on the podcast have included <strong>Julie Andrews</strong>, <strong>Patti Smith</strong>, <strong>Vera Wang</strong>, <strong>Carol Burnett</strong>, <strong>Billie Jean King</strong> and <strong>Jane Fonda</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Louis-Dreyfus told The New York Times that creating “Wiser Than Me” has encouraged her to share more of her personal life with the public.</p><p>“I’ve never done anything like this. It sort of surprises me a little bit. I’m incredibly private — I really am. So it is sort of a strange thing,” she said. “But I also don’t have any regrets about what I’ve shared on the podcast. It is new territory for me, but it’s also good. I think it engenders a way of thinking about communication that might be good.”</p><p>Louis-Dreyfus has just finished production on Marvel’s Thunderbolts, set for a 2025 release, in which she will <a href=# rel=noopener>continue her role</a> as Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, a super spy, alongside <strong>Florence Pugh</strong>, <strong>David Harbor</strong> and <strong>Sebastian Stan</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajrZyerm64zq6grGWUp7K6stSsZJ6woKGuqrrSZq6hsV2otaZ51p6lrWWkpHq1tMSrmKmxXay2tbSMoZyrZZ2kunA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./karem-aalgaisy-justbeingkareem-height-age-girlfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-10260-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Karem Aalgaisy Justbeingkareem Height, Age, Girlfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jb-bernstein-net-worth-2021-age-wikipedia-biography-height-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>JB Bernstein Net Worth, Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Height, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

At one point they were able to remove their masks and continued talking while Kate, 39, fell a few steps behind.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I cannot imagine those two brothers starting in that line and that [funeral] procession — going through what they went through as brothers and being as thick as thieves as they said before — and not speaking to one another until after the service,” Swann added. “You recognize two siblings trying to pull it together. I think Harry was doing his best to say, ‘Hey, you know, bro, we’re still here. I’m still here. I still love you.’ And I believe William did his best to open his body language toward his brother.”</p><p>For now, Harry is happy to be back in the U.S. with <a href=#>Archie</a>, 23 months, and Markle, 39, who couldn’t travel for the funeral because of <a href=#>her pregnancy</a>. “Harry couldn’t wait to return to his heavily pregnant wife and Archie, and is happy to be back in Montecito,” the source added.</p><p>The couple also have a major task ahead of them: <a href=#>choosing a name</a> for their newest family member. “[They] have not settled on one yet,” an insider told Us, adding that they want the name “to have meaning” so they’re taking their time choosing. “There are some top picks for names but nothing concrete.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ5x5qpq7Fdm66utcuyZKGZppq7tXnAnZurnaOosqV5yKernqqmnrK4ecOrmKaZXZbBbrjEp56toF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./series-finale-seven-reasons-well-miss-fringe-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Series Finale Time: Seven Reasons Well Miss Fringe</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-harry-meghan-markle-deny-relationship-problems-pda-heavy-outing-amid-royal-health-crises.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prince Harry And Meghan Markle Deny Relationship Problems With PDA-Heavy Outing Amid Royal Health Cr</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

After season two, it became obvious that the show was going to be a massive hit.It changed the careers of the main six, including <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong> who went on to thrive in film, and in the recent years, back to TV thanks to the likes The Morning Show. <span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Nobody Wanted Joey And Rachel Together On Friends So Why Did The Creators Do It Anyway?</a></span>Given the success of Friends, the show has quite the devoted fanbase. As we've seen over the years, it is hard to get anything passed the fans.In the following, we'll prove that to be correct, as on multiple occasions, fans noticed a set filler standing in for Rachel during scenes. In one instance, the fake Rachel was seen thanks to the changing of the ratio format to the episode. We'll take a look back at the moment, along with another instance of a fake Rachel being caught in a shot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends-had-a-different-approach-when-it-came-to-shooting-episodes>Friends Had A Different Approach When It Came To Shooting Episodes</h2><p>Friends had a tendency of doing things differently. To the show's credit, the formula clearly worked, as the sitcom thrived for ten seasons and will continue to do so for many more years, thanks to their syndication rights.</p><p>One of the things the show did differently, was their ability to listen to the audience. If the crowd did react in a certain way, they were willing to change the line on the fly, something that is a big time 'no no' for other sitcoms.</p><p><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow asking the audience if they understood a joke</a> while shooting the Vegas episode is a classic example.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Budget Cuts Would Lead To One Of The Most Iconic Episodes In Friends History</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show would also <a href=#>listen to the audience after an ovation for Monica and Chandlers' first hookup</a>. The moment between the two wasn't intended to be anything serious, however, it all changed given how into it the audience was. This caused the show to keep them together for the long-term.</p><p><a href=#>Not every moment was as perfect as Ross' "I take thee Rahcel" line.</a> In fact, fans noticed a stand-in for Rachel on multiple occasions.</p><h2 id=the-rachel-stand-in-was-spotted-not-once-but-twice-thanks-to-the-aspect-ratio>The Rachel Stand-In Was Spotted Not Once, But Twice Thanks To The Aspect Ratio</h2><p>It is almost impossible to fool Friends fans... That includes, quick takes that feature stand-ins for certain characters. This usually takes place when a scene needs to be reshot, and the person isn't really part of the scene, so a filler is used instead with the same clothes.</p><p>However, Friends fans decided to widen the lens of a particular episode, and they would instantly notice a stand-in as Rachel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Did Christine Taylor Really Shave Her Head As Bonnie On Friends?</a></span></p><p>In the comment section of the same tweet, a fan noticed another moment, showing once again a fake Rachel for a split second when the camera is cutting, alongside Joey and Monica.</p><p>Props to the fans for pointing these moments out. For what it is worth, a stand-in was also spotted for Monica at the coffee house. Neat to see that all these years later, fans of the series are still noticing little glitches that took place behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends-had-lots-of-other-scenes-that-didn-t-make-the-final-cut>Friends Had Lots Of Other Scenes That Didn't Make The Final Cut</h2><p>There were several scenes that came close to airing, but ultimately did not make it to the final cut. One of them, included <a href=#>Monica and Chandler at the airport for their honeymoon, getting stopped for using the word 'bomb'.</a> It was sensitive moment at the time, with 9-11 taking place. This caused the Friends creators to ultimately remove the scene and use it as a deleted scene extra on the DVD.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another moment in particular, was canceled altogether and didn't even make it to production. Alongside Andy Cohen, <a href=#>Matthew Perry recalled instantly turning down a storyline,</a> which seemed for suitable for Joey given that it involved sandwiches.</p><p>He recalls, "There was a story line on 'Friends' where Chandler went to a male strip joint because he really liked the sandwiches," Perry recalled. "And I called up and I said, 'Let's not do this one.'"</p><p>Perry got his way and in truth, the show used a lot of his creative output for Chandler along the way, including the unique way he was able to deliver his lines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqOVYr%2Bir8eeo2ahnmKubr%2FCnqWeZaeewal5yaicsmWfo3qnvsiepZ2rXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./guy-lockard-wikipedia-age-height-instagram-net-worth-partner.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Guy Lockard Wikipedia, Age, Height, Instagram, Net Worth, Partner</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./former-wwe-wrestler-anoai-dies-at-47.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Former WWE wrestler Anoa'i dies at 47</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

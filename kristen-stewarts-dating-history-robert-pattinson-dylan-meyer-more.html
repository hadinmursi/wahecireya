The couple <a href=#>played love interests on screen</a> before taking their relationship to the next level.</p><p>After going public in 2009, Stewart and Pattinson <a href=#>broke up three years later when photos surfaced</a> of her kissing her Snow White and the Huntsman director, <a href=#><strong>Rupert Sanders</strong></a>. The pair ultimately reconciled but <a href=#>parted ways for a final time</a> in 2013.</p><p>The Charlie’s Angels star later opened up about <a href=#>having to weather major ups and down</a>s in her first high-profile romance.</p><p>“I wasn’t hiding anything. I didn’t talk about my first relationships that went public because I wanted things that are mine to be mine,” she told the Sunday Times in March 2017 about the U.K. native. “I hated it that details of my life were being turned into a commodity and peddled around the world. But considering I had so many eyes on me, I suddenly realized [my private life] affects a greater number of people than just me. It was an opportunity to surrender a bit of what was mine, to make even one other person feel good about themselves.”</p><p>According to Stewart, her romance with the Batman star <a href=#>was not meant to work out</a>. “When me and Rob were together, we did not have an example to go by. So much was taken from us that, in trying to control one aspect, we were just, like, ‘No, we will never talk about it. Never. Because it’s ours,” she told Harper’s Bazaar U.K. in 2019.</p><p>The Panic actress was later linked to model <a href=#><strong>Stella Maxwell</strong></a>, who she dated on and off from 2016 until 2019. Later that year, Stewart sparked romance speculation <a href=#>when she was spotted with screenwriter <strong>Dylan Meyer</strong></a>, who she had initially met on set years prior.</p><p>At the time, the Academy Award nominee discussed how dating in the public eye <a href=#>affected her journey with her sexuality.</a></p><p>“The first time I ever dated a girl, I was immediately being asked if I was a lesbian. And it’s like, ‘God, I’m 21 years old.’ I felt like maybe there were things that have hurt people I’ve been with. Not because I felt ashamed of being openly gay but because I didn’t like giving myself to the public, in a way. It felt like such thievery. This was a period of time when I was sort of cagey,” she explained to InStyle in November 2020. “Even in my previous relationships, which were straight, we did everything we could to not be photographed doing things — things that would become not ours. So I think the added pressure of representing a group of people, of representing queerness, wasn’t something I understood then. Only now can I see it.”</p><p>Three months after their her first public outing with Meyer, the Happiest Season star gushed that she was<a href=#> looking forward to proposing to her girlfriend</a> in the future.</p><p>“I‘ve known her for, like, six years, but we only started seeing each other [romantically]. Two weeks in, it was literally, like, the day that I met her, all bets were off,” Stewart explained on The Howard Stern Show in November 2019. “I met her years ago on a movie. I hadn’t seen her in, like, two years and she had just walked up to a friend’s birthday party and I was just, like, ‘Where have you been and how have I not known you?’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One year later, Stewart confirmed that she had <a href=#>popped the question and the twosome were engaged.</a></p><p>Scroll down for Stewart’s complete dating history:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuLO10q2cp2WjqbK4rdGtqmackam2r7OMoaCsrJ%2Bnxm6%2Bzpucq6xdpa61wMinqqimXZnGra3NZqSesZWneq670Z5m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-lauryn-hill-arrested-tax-evasion-left-music-industry.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lauryn Hill Became A Different Person After She Was Arrested For Tax Evasion And Briefly Left The Mu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kelenna-azubuike-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-472408-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kelenna Azubuike Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

Parker’s height, weight, and body measurements, all we can say is “why not,” but before we get to that, let’s see some facts about the star.</span></p><p><span>See Also: Floyd Mayweather’s Girlfriend, Wife, Daughters, Children, Mother</span></p><ul><li><span>He was born William Anthony “Tony” Parker Jr. on May 17, 1982 in Bruges, Belgium and raised in France.</span></li><li><span>You better believe basketball runs in saveines as he is, in fact, a second-generation athlete.&nbsp;His father, Tony Parker Sr., of African American descent, played basketball at Loyola University Chicago and overseas.</span></li><li><span>He is not an only child, the star has two younger brothers named TJ and Pierre.</span></li><li><span>Being bilingual (he speaks fluent English and French) is not the only way for the star to be flexible, if not a fairly talented basketball player, he also has a predilection for music, rap and hip- hop being his favorites.&nbsp;He even has his own album named&nbsp;</span><strong><span>TP</span></strong></li></ul><ul><li><span>Her mother is Dutch and her father is African American, so you might be wondering how the star is actually French.&nbsp;He is a French citizen and he is even part of the French national basketball team.&nbsp;Besides that, he is the biggest shareholder of a professional basketball club in France, Asvel.</span></li><li><span>This knowledge probably already common, but we will tell you anyway.&nbsp;The star was involved in a high profile relationship with Eva Longoria.&nbsp;The two were even married, but it was rumored that his infidelity ended her.&nbsp;The star did not confess to this claim.</span></li><li><span>This hasn’t dented her love life, however, as the star is currently married to French journalist Axelle Francine and the couple currently have two sons.</span></li></ul><p><span>Well, that’s enough random info on the star, let’s get to the topic starting with Tony Parker.</span></p><p><span>See also: Wife, son, girlfriend and family of Lionel Messi</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tony-parkers-height></span><span>Tony Parker’s Height</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Well, he is a basketball player so he is expected to be one of the few criteria that would make one a good basketball player, besides being good at the sport.&nbsp;It’s not like football or golf which doesn’t require a lot of physical appearance, more like sumo, but basketball.</span></p><p><span>Given the information above, it’s no surprise that the star is 6-foot-2 tall, now that’s the height of a basketball player.&nbsp;Using other notable figures as a point of reference, most people would say the star is at least two inches tall, but you know how it sits in those regions… the height listed is equivalent.</span></p><p><span>Here is a list of notable personalities who stand as tall as the star according to its indicated size.&nbsp;Will Smith, Gerard Butler, Daniel Day-Lewis, James Cameron and Thierry Henry all share Tony Parker’s strengths.</span></p><p><span>See also: The children, sons, daughters and family of Michael Jordan</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tony-parkers-weight></span><span>Tony Parker’s weight</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>He’s a sportsman so let’s just go out on a branch here and say the star is pretty fit… sure he looks pretty fit, all 84 kilograms of him.&nbsp;For someone with his height and stature, it’s actually quite an adequate weight for him.&nbsp;So how does the star achieve this?</span></p><p><span>It’s all about balance, he doesn’t have a specific diet he follows, but he takes everything in moderation, including drink as he likes wine.&nbsp;That’s not all it does, it also takes a lot of training and exercise to carve it.&nbsp;He specifically pointed out that he lifts a lot to keep him strong and to keep his weight down.&nbsp;It sounds doable, but you’ll never know until you try… so try.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tony-parker-body-net-worth></span><span>Tony Parker Body Net Worth</span><span

This crime gave detectives one of their biggest leads as a man who came to the store to pick up a cummerbund saw the killer inside the store. The killer tried to order the man to stay inside the store at gunpoint with the distinct murder weapon, but the man ran away and gave police the description that has been used in police sketches.</li><li>April 27, 1992: Michael McCown was found shot to death at Sylvia's Ceramics in Terre Haute, Indiana.</li><li>May 3, 1992: Nancy Kitzmiller was found shot to death in St. Charles.</li><li>May 7, 1992: Sarah Blessing was found shot to the death at a small store in Raytown, Missouri, near Kansas City.</li><li>Sept. 25, 1993: Mary Ann Glasscock was killed at the Emporium Antiques stores in Fort Worth.&nbsp;</li><li>Nov. 1, 1993: Amy Vess was shot to death in a dance apparel store in Arlington, Texas.&nbsp;</li><li>Jan. 15, 1994: Vicki Webb was shot in the back of the head in the Alternatives gift shop but survived.

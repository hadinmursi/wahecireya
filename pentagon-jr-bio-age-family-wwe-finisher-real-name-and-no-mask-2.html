With PWG he is a former one-time PWG World Tag Team Champion.</p><p>Pentagón Jr. initially became known for his tenure with AAA between 2010 and 2017, where he is a former Latin American Champion, Mixed Tag Team Champion, World Tag Team Championship and the 2016 Rey de Reyes.</p><p>In January 2017, he left AAA and announced that he was working for The Crash and formed a group called La Rebelión (“The Rebellion”) with other former AAA wrestlers. By mid-2018 it was announced that AAA and Pentagón Jr. had come to an agreement to work together again.</p><p>His real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico, where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.</p><p>His brother is also a luchador, known as Fénix / Rey Fénix, the two form a tag team called “Lucha Brothers” or “Lucha Bros”. Together they have held multiple tag team championships in Mexico and the United States.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pentagon-jr-age></span>Pentagón Jr. Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pentagón Jr. is 34 years old. born on26 February 1985.</p><p><strong>Pentagón Jr. Photo</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pentagon-jr-family></span>Pentagón Jr. Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pentagón Jr’s. father and two brothers are also professional wrestlers; his father worked as Fuego, while his brothers perform under the ring names Fénix and Niño de Fuego. not much is known about his family but you will be updated soon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pentagon-jr-wwe></span>Pentagón Jr. WWE<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As is the norm when wrestlers achieve this level of success and visibility, wrestling fans started to hear rumors that Penta and Fénix could be headed to WWE. Earlier, the Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that WWE was interested in signing the brothers.</p><p>Major League Wrestling (for whom the Lucha Brothers are currently tag team champions) added fuel to the fire by tweeting, “It’s been an incredible 2018 for the #LuchaBros! And a monumental moment is on the horizon for @ReyFenixMx and @PENTAELZEROM as we hear what 2019 holds for them.</p><p>MLW fans may be shocked to see what’s nxt!”.And Fénix sure didn’t dispel those rumors about his nxt career move when he shared a screencap of that tweet on his own account.</p><p>However, the other brother took a moment to address whether or not he’s WWE-bound after defeating Hammerstone to retain his PCW ULTRA (Hey, that’s where we do most of the interviews for McMahonsplaining!) Championship.</p><p>After putting his opponent over as the future of PCW, Penta El Zero M (as he’s booked in this promotion) told the audience, “I am not going anywhere. Penta will be in PCW for many more years.” So it looks like those WWE rumors have lost a Grave Consequences match, at least for now.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pentagon-jr-real-name></span>Pentagón Jr. Real Name<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Pentagón Jr. real name has not been made on public records as it is well known that most of the Mexico wrestlers put on masks in order to keep their private life a secret.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=pentagon-jr-finisher></span>Pentagón Jr. Finisher<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Finishers moves</strong><br>1.Fear Factor (Package Piledriver)<br>2.Lanza (Diving double foot stomp) – adopted from Perro Aguayo, Jr.<br>3.

She spent decades by Freddie Mercury's side, as his girlfriend for a few years, and as his best friend for the rest of his life. The memories, at a certain point, seem to have gotten too intense, and she methodically emptied the house, selling, moving, or giving away the singer's things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"This house has been the most glorious memory box, because it has such love and warmth in every room," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary Austin said in a statement</a>. "It has been a joy to live in and I have many wonderful memories here. Now that it is empty, Iâ€™m transported back to the first time we viewed it."</strong></p><p>As hard as it will be to get rid of it, she knows it will be the perfect home for whoever gets to live there next. <strong>"Ever since Freddie and I stepped through the fabled green door, it has been a place of peace, a true artist's house, and now is the time to entrust that sense of peace to the next person."</strong></p><h2 id=what-freddie-mercury-said-about-his-famous-garden-lodge>What Freddie Mercury Said About His Famous Garden Lodge</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/freddie-mercury-on-stage.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apparently, Freddie Mercury shared Mary Austin's appreciation of the beautiful house he ended up buying.

Page Six reports that she will have the opportunity to speak about her father and Scientology (although she was six when her mother took her away from that life). Scientology expert Tony Ortega told Page Six, "Suri would have been too young to sign any agreement, but she will now be free to talk if she wants to, and it's going to be really interesting if she has something to say." <strong>In contrast, Holmes has not publicly spoken out and is believed to have signed non-disclosure agreements that have prevented her from doing so</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The outlet also discussed Suri and Tom's relationship with former Scientology spokesperson Mike Rinder, who is reportedly estranged from his own children.

"I'm learning every day, and I have been since the minute I became a mom." In the interview, she also commented on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how she had more patience</a> and discussed the lessons she was trying to teach Suri. "Between tickle fights and glitter art, I try to throw in some manners along the way. I try to have good manners, too, so that's what she sees. I also try to be very creative with her because I know she's an artist, and that speaks to the girl in me," Holmes said. "To be honest? I'm not going to play tag, probably. That's not top of my list.

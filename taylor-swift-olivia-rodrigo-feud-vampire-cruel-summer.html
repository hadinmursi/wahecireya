When Rodrigo was first rising in popularity with her music, she expressed her adoration for Swift and even claimed to be inspired by Swift's music. Rodrigo has shared many covers of Swift's music over the years, and Swift has expressed her support for the young artist. Swift even gifted Rodrigo a ring as a gesture of support, and when they finally met in person in 2021 fans were over the moon about their pictures together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Taylor Swift Is Adding To Her Current $740 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Though they had a sweet beginning to a friendship, the relationship between Swift and Rodrigo has had some tensions in recent years.

Rodrigo entered the entertainment industry as an actress, appearing on the Disney television shows Bizaardvark and High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.</p><p>After her music career began to take off with songs such as "Driver's License" and "Good 4 U," <a href=#>Rodrigo exited </a><a href=#>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</a> in order to focus solely on her growing career as a musician.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/olivia-rodrigo-smiling-1.jpg><p>Rodrigo has not been shy about her love for Swift.

After Rodrigo released her debut album Sour, fans of Swift were quick to point out the similarities between Rodrigo's "Deja Vu" and Swift's "Cruel Summer."</p><p>Swift was always credited for songwriting on Rodrigo's "1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back," as the song uses the music in Swift's "New Year's Day." Considering Rodrigo had been proactive about giving songwriting credit for this song, fans were shocked when so many of her other songs were called out for plagiarism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52180554.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It was never actually confirmed if Swift sued Rodrigo for the plagiarism</a>, and it seems like technically she did not sue the younger artist. However, Swift and her team did reach out to Rodrigo and accuse her of the crime, which caused Rodrigo to give Swift songwriting credit on "Deja Vu."</p><p>Rodrigo was forced to pay millions in royalties to Swift and other artists for the plagiarism.</p><p>"I think it's disappointing to see people take things out of context and discredit any young woman's work," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rodrigo told Teen Vogue at the time of the scandal with Swift</a>. "Every single artist is inspired by artists who have come before them. It's sort of a fun, beautiful sharing process. Nothing in music is ever new. There's four chords in every song. That's the fun part--trying to make that your own."</p><p>Rodrigo was certainly caught off guard by the business side of music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=does-olivia-rodrigo-shade-taylor-swift-in-quot-vampire-quot>Does Olivia Rodrigo Shade Taylor Swift In "Vampire"?</h2><p>Since the credit scandal, it is not shocking that things have been a little awkward between Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift. Whether an actual lawsuit was involved, Rodrigo was forced to give up songwriting credit and royalties to Swift. Tensions have certainly been high.</p><p>Rodrigo released her sophomore album Guts in early September 2023, and her fans are already diving deep into the lyrics. People are trying to figure out the inspiration behind her new songs, and the songs "Vampire" and "The Grudge" are particularly interesting to fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Olivia Rodrigo Was Only 5 When The First Twilight Movie Came Out, But Her New Single May Be Connected To The Vampire Franchise In This Way</a></span></p><p>Fans think that the two songs are actually about Swift.

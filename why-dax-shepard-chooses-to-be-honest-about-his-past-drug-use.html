I could advance this whole thing, but I don’t want to tell people I’ve done cocaine so now I can’t advance it because of that. They all end up being little roadblocks along the way.”</p><p>The episode was recorded before the Hit and Run star revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he had relapsed on opioids </a>during his 16-year sobriety journey. Shepard got candid about his struggles on the September 25 episode of his “Armchair Expert” podcast. The Chips star revealed he was seven days sober after misusing prescription drugs in the wake of multiple incidents, including the death of his father in 2013 and a motorcycle accident in August.</p><p>Shepard also recalled his 16th sobriety birthday celebration, which he called “the worst hour of my life,” during the episode. “I was high at the meeting having people tell me they admire my sobriety,” he said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Employee of the Month star eventually told his wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kristen Bell</strong></a>, about his relapse and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began attending meetings. </a>A source told Us Weekly at the time that Bell, 40, is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">standing by the actor’s side</a> following his confession.

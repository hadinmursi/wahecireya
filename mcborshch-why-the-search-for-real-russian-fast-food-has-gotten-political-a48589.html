When the&nbsp;news hit Facebook and&nbsp;Twitter, a&nbsp;steady stream of&nbsp;columns and&nbsp;posts fulminated over the&nbsp;fact that two very wealthy brothers were asking the&nbsp;state for&nbsp;a billion rubles for&nbsp;a commercial venture. Reports from&nbsp;the Kremlin since say that the&nbsp;news reports were wrong, and&nbsp;that the&nbsp;brothers weren't actually trying to&nbsp;borrow money from&nbsp;the budget but were looking to&nbsp;get support otherwise. These new reports proved useless as the&nbsp;op-eds were already out and&nbsp;a train of&nbsp;public outrage had built up an&nbsp;unstoppable head of&nbsp;steam.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.themoscowtimes.com/image/original/cc/60a09466170945e88604f23c1cbe08eb.jpg width=658 height=394 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The Calvert Journal</p><p>A&nbsp;Kroshka Kartoshka baked potato with a&nbsp;"traditional" Russian filling.</p><p>And&nbsp;as for&nbsp;their proposed fast food chain, it was supposed to&nbsp;work under the&nbsp;Edim Doma franchise ("We're Eating at&nbsp;Home" in&nbsp;Russian), a&nbsp;cooking TV show and&nbsp;brand owned by&nbsp;Konchalovsky's wife, Yulia Vysotskaya&nbsp;— an&nbsp;announcement that caused many commenters to&nbsp;blame the&nbsp;director brothers of&nbsp;nepotism. The&nbsp;basic concept of&nbsp;this proposed business is a&nbsp;healthier, more culturally native Russian fast food, everything McDonald's isn't&nbsp;— not exactly an&nbsp;evil idea. Only, their proposal and&nbsp;request for&nbsp;help from&nbsp;the state implied that these things don't already exist, that the&nbsp;niche of&nbsp;Russian fast food is empty and&nbsp;there is no one to&nbsp;stand up to&nbsp;the evil globalized McDonald's&nbsp;— and&nbsp;that is not entirely true. In&nbsp;fact, there have been several attempts at&nbsp;creating fast-food brands with a&nbsp;national identity, some have failed miserably but others still work.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.themoscowtimes.com/image/original/ad/16dc4a9de0ba4186a4d8ef35c9565a6d.jpg width=658 height=394 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Brateevsky under a&nbsp;CC licence</p><p>A&nbsp;kiosk of&nbsp;Teremok, a&nbsp;chain that claims to&nbsp;serve "traditional" Russian dishes in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;fast-food.<br></p><p>First, there was BlinDonalds, a&nbsp;fast-food chain built around the&nbsp;idea of&nbsp;good Russian food, with the&nbsp;name shamelessly ripped from&nbsp;McDonald's. It was owned by&nbsp;a company belonging to&nbsp;Yevgeny Prigozhin, reportedly a&nbsp;close friend of&nbsp;President Vladimir Putin. The&nbsp;chain, widely criticized for&nbsp;cheap food processed to&nbsp;the point of&nbsp;tastelessness, existed for&nbsp;several years before going out of&nbsp;business in&nbsp;2012. Then there is Teremok, originally a&nbsp;chain of&nbsp;kiosks selling blini (crepes with fillings) that grew into&nbsp;a successful chain of&nbsp;fast-food cafes serving simple Russian and&nbsp;Soviet food.<br></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.themoscowtimes.com/image/original/25/07d5b3ae5f4b4bcca8fec91ae9486b1e.jpg width=658 height=394 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The Calvert Jounal<br></p><p>Teremok chain also runs outdoor kiosks than can be found around the&nbsp;city.<br></p><p>The&nbsp;company made some good choices, like serving food appropriate for&nbsp;Orthodox Lent all year round (which means vegetarian-friendly, which the&nbsp;Russian McDonald's still hasn't become) and&nbsp;keeping the&nbsp;prices low. Among other brands are Chainaya Lozhka, Yolki-Palki, and&nbsp;Kroshka Kartoshka&nbsp;— less popular and&nbsp;mostly regarded as train station food, but still managing to&nbsp;survive and&nbsp;open new cafes. These places all have various degrees of&nbsp;Russianness, from&nbsp;the very subtle in&nbsp;Kroshka Kartoshka to&nbsp;the sometimes absurd in&nbsp;Teremok where, for&nbsp;some time, the&nbsp;staff were required to&nbsp;address guests as sudar and&nbsp;sudarina, pre-revolutionary honorific titles that made every contact with a&nbsp;customer hysterically awkward.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.themoscowtimes.com/image/original/6e/993a9cda6b0c471ab99340a22fd6e806.jpg width=658 height=394 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Werz under a&nbsp;CC licence</p><p>A&nbsp;Kroshka Kartoshka stand offering several types of&nbsp;beer along with potato-based meals.</p><p>Fast-food joints aside, the&nbsp;trend for&nbsp;native food also manifested itself in&nbsp;a more exclusive hipster space of&nbsp;street food markets and&nbsp;restaurants, where pre-Soviet food made its claim for&nbsp;fame through Yamal venison and&nbsp;Siberian fish.</p><p>But still, in&nbsp;every instance, whether it is cheap fast food or overpriced street food, both the&nbsp;product and&nbsp;the concept sold to&nbsp;us seem artificial and&nbsp;awkward compared to&nbsp;burgers, kebabs and&nbsp;spicy chicken wings. And&nbsp;it's not the&nbsp;artificiality and&nbsp;awkwardness of&nbsp;eating an&nbsp;artisan hot dog and&nbsp;feeling like a&nbsp;character out of&nbsp;a New Yorker comment piece or one of&nbsp;the horsemen of&nbsp;the gentrification apocalypse. It's the&nbsp;artificiality and&nbsp;awkwardness that come from&nbsp;a cultural void of&nbsp;being sold a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;food that doesn't bring the&nbsp;promised meaning: this is not "our" native fast/street food, this is a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;local meat in&nbsp;a burger bun of&nbsp;globalization. What it brings to&nbsp;the national food industry is not "native fast food," just some slightly localized recipes of&nbsp;Western fast food.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.themoscowtimes.com/image/original/dc/0663602cb6634d889da0ab15754cceab.jpg width=658 height=394 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The Calvert Journal<br></p><p>One of&nbsp;Kroshka Kartoshka's numerous outdoor booths.<br></p><p>At&nbsp;the same time, there is a&nbsp;whole culture of&nbsp;already existing street food that is popular and&nbsp;native if not to&nbsp;Russia specifically then to&nbsp;the post-Soviet space generally: food based on&nbsp;Caucasian and&nbsp;Georgian cuisines: shashliks and&nbsp;kababi (different types of&nbsp;kebab meat); shaurma or shaverma (shawarma or doner wraps); khachapuri (cheese filled pies); and&nbsp;chebureki (fried flat pastries with meat or cheese and&nbsp;herbs). These foods have a&nbsp;history of&nbsp;being sold and&nbsp;eaten in&nbsp;the Russian streets, and&nbsp;because of&nbsp;the Soviet Union they have been here for&nbsp;so long, they come off as "ours." These foods are handy to&nbsp;eat while you walk, and&nbsp;most people in&nbsp;Russia will probably have memories of&nbsp;them that make these foods a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;our lives: like eating a&nbsp;hot khachapuri, flaky puff pastry with hot melted cheese inside, in&nbsp;a park with one's parents, or sneakily having a&nbsp;shaverma with a&nbsp;friend after school, knowing it will spoil your appetite for&nbsp;dinner later. These foods are what burgers and&nbsp;hot dogs are to&nbsp;most Americans&nbsp;— where they eat hot dogs on&nbsp;the 4th of&nbsp;July, Russians get out of&nbsp;the city for&nbsp;the May holidays to&nbsp;grill shashliks. It helps that Georgian and&nbsp;Caucasian cuisines are generally recognized as the&nbsp;most delicious foods to&nbsp;come out of&nbsp;the Soviet Union, with more flavor and&nbsp;variety than other post-Soviet dishes. The&nbsp;Washington Post recently predicted Georgian cuisine would be the&nbsp;next big thing in&nbsp;the West.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.themoscowtimes.com/image/original/98/0024d20caad640ec9106445e7e92fd05.jpg width=658 height=394 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Mussels under a&nbsp;CC licence</p><p>A&nbsp;half of&nbsp;khachapuri, a&nbsp;traditional Georgian dish of&nbsp;cheese-filled bread.</p><p>However, the&nbsp;business of&nbsp;these foods is rather marginalized and&nbsp;there are very few recognizable brands&nbsp;— most shawarma and&nbsp;khachapuris are sold in&nbsp;kiosks or small cafes where you have to&nbsp;eat while standing up. Some of&nbsp;these places look suspicious and&nbsp;not exactly clean, the&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;place you might not go inside unless you have a&nbsp;recommendation from&nbsp;a friend who assured you won't be poisoned. But some bigger businesses have already started to&nbsp;recognize the&nbsp;potential and&nbsp;the dormant powers of&nbsp;these foods. A&nbsp;chain of&nbsp;Georgian fast-food cafes called Vai Me ("Why Me" in&nbsp;English) serve simple Georgian foods like khinkali (giant meat dumplings) and&nbsp;lobio (bean-based pate, usually eaten with lavash bread), affordable and&nbsp;fast, in&nbsp;three locations in&nbsp;central Moscow. They also recently announced that they have plans for&nbsp;a cafe in&nbsp;Budapest, the&nbsp;new hipster Mecca that has thrown Berlin off the&nbsp;top of&nbsp;the European cool list, so it's safe to&nbsp;say that their claim to&nbsp;foodie fame is a&nbsp;serious one. Other businesses in&nbsp;the know of&nbsp;the trend are the&nbsp;countless Ossetian pie delivery services&nbsp;— easily outnumbering pizza deliveries and&nbsp;offering a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;pies with fillings of&nbsp;cheese, meat and&nbsp;leafy greens, originating form Ossetia, a&nbsp;region in&nbsp;Georgia. To&nbsp;stand up to&nbsp;the competition, some pizza companies even started to&nbsp;add Ossetian pies to&nbsp;their menus.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.themoscowtimes.com/image/original/80/f5b9c764f21245b7b8555ebb488ae4f9.jpg width=658 height=394 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>The Calvert Journal<br></p><p>A&nbsp;fast-food blin with berries served in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;Teremok's kiosks.<br></p><p>So does Russia need another fast food attempting to&nbsp;address our cultural identity via borshchs and&nbsp;blinis? Perhaps, for&nbsp;the competition's sake&nbsp;— though not funded by&nbsp;the state. And&nbsp;unless some marketing genius magically rebrands borshch, it's not going to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;go-to fast/street food dish in&nbsp;Russia. What we really need is a&nbsp;less marginalized version of&nbsp;the foods we are used to, the&nbsp;shashliks and&nbsp;shavermas. Even if they are not exactly directly native to&nbsp;Russian culture, we probably have the&nbsp;Soviet concept of&nbsp;the peoples' friendship to&nbsp;thank for&nbsp;the delight we feel every time we bite into&nbsp;a piece of&nbsp;Adjarian khachapuri.</p><p><i>This article first appeared in&nbsp;<a href=#>The Calvert Journal</a>, a&nbsp;guide to&nbsp;the new east.<br></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpqasm5%2Bswaq5xKxlnKedZH9xfZRoZ3BnYm18rq%2FBqKmsoJOderi02GaroZ1dqLKivsKhZJ%2BnomK%2Fpq3LZqmuq6Oerq95xZqqrWWWpLyleceaqmafn6nBprqMqaaloaSesKK4jJprcW1obg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-was-how-i-met-your-father-canceled-after-season-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Was How I Met Your Father Canceled After Season 2?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-real-reason-why-dax-shepards-bless-this-mess-cancelled.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Dax Shepard's 'Bless This Mess' Got Canceled Despite The Ratings Going Up</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

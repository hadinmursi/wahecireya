The reality star first appeared on season 6 of <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a> alongside his now <a href=#>ex-wife <strong>Larissa Dos Santos Lima</strong></a>. He went on to star in seasons 4 and 5 of 90 Day Fiancé: Happily After Ever? and appeared alongside his mom on season 2 of 90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk.</p><p>However, in the latest 90 Day Fiancé spinoff, The Single Life, the 36-year-old’s dating life will be explored even further — and he’s made some adjustments to his methods!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/90-Day-Fiance-Colt-Johnson-Changes-His-Dating-Habits-on-The-Single-Life-Spinoff.jpg><p>“I’ve been married and divorced and going through another relationship really opened my eyes. I think what I want going forward is just the smaller things,” Johnson told Us Weekly exclusively while promoting The Single Life. “I think I just want <a href=#>communication, foundation, a good friendship</a>. I think it would be a great start and these are things I never really had in my relationships prior.”</p><p>The reality TV star also noted that what he’s looking for now is a bit different after such volatile relationships.</p><p>“I’m dating domestic now,” Johnson told Us. “I’ve given up on foreign girls. This is the first time I’m dating locally in Las Vegas. So I’m very excited [about] just finding people I have more things in common with. I just want to get to know people. I spent a lot of time online dating [and] long-distance dating. So for me, I’m going about it a little differently.”</p><p>Johnson and the Brazil native, 34, married in June 2018. In January 2019, she was arrested for domestic battery for the third time after an alleged fight. Two days later, he <a href=#>filed for divorce</a>, which was finalized in May of that year. In 2020, he was <a href=#>linked to friend <strong>Vanessa Guerra</strong></a> and dated Jess Caroline.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Day-Fiances-Colt-Is-Attempting-to-Cancel-Larissas-Green-Card.jpg><p>While he’s still meeting people online, the software engineer said he’s also tried different ways of connecting with women.</p><p>“It’s other things — friends, friends of friends, speed dating. That is something that’s interesting,” he told Us. “I’m just trying to try different ways to meet people and not just through a DM basically.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Although his past relationships have been filled with ups and downs, Johnson noted that he’s really learned a lot about himself while on the journey.</p><p>“I definitely need to be more honest and open and just transparent with everything. If I’m unhappy, for any reason, I need to express that,” he said. “The most important thing is just to be OK with walking away and let everything fall. … Right now, I’m not afraid of just being by myself. I had a lot of practice over the last year.”</p><p>90 Day: The Single Life and The Single Life Pillow Talk premiere on Discovery+ Sunday, February 21.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaHBpZZSWxm6yyJqlnJ2jYrCwuNNmoaignqi8r3nHmqpmn5mrsq951KlkqKZdma61tc2gZJ%2Bnopq2qLqMoKCrpKNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aida-rodriguez-comedian-husband-age-height-son-net-worth-netflix-they-ready.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aida Rodriguez Comedian Husband, Age, Height, Son, Net Worth Netflix They Ready</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1255447-wwe-supershow-results-from-north-charleston-sc-9-18-21.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>WWE Live Event Results From North Charleston, SC (9/18/21)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

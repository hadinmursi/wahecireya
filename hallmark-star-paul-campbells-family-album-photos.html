The Unexpected Christmas writer starred in two more hits for the network between 2014 and 2015 before taking a break from acting to focus on his biggest role yet: being a father.</p><p>“Around the time my son was born, I took some time off. It was weird because we had actually been in Los Angeles the year prior to that,” Campbell told <a href=#>My Devotional Thoughts</a> in July 2018, confirming that his son, Kingston, was born in April 2016. “I was off for about six months before my son was born, and after he was born, I just took off the rest of the year.”</p><p>The Spun Out alum — who shares Kingston with <a href=#>wife <strong>Lorie Metz</strong></a>, whom he wed in June 2009 — explained that he was out of the entertainment hustle and bustle for about eighteen months before he “<a href=#>decided it was time to get back on the horse</a>.”</p><p>Campbell’s return to Hallmark came in 2017 with Sun, Sand & Romance. The rom-com marked his first gig as a producer and the first time <a href=#>his son joined him on location for filming</a>.</p><p>“I was at home looking after the kiddo, and I realized I could be doing writing at home,” the Canada native said, revealing he pitched the idea for Sun, Sand & Romance to the network. “And so that pushed me into the development/creative direction that I’m really having fun pursuing now.”</p><p>The following year, Kingston, <a href=#>who had Sagittal synostosis surgery</a> shortly after his birth, once again joined his dad on set. (Campbell’s son <a href=#>has since recovered from his procedure</a>, which was focused on creating a normal skull shape with more room for his brain to grow.)</p><p>“Bring your kiddo to work day — did he enjoy the snacks or the snow more?” the Battlestar Galactica alum teased via <a href=#>Instagram in August 2018</a> while working on A Godwink Christmas.</p><p>In September 2019, Kingston was <a href=#>his dad’s “special visitor”</a> while he worked on a <a href=#>Hallmark Movies & Mysteries project</a>. “He was less impressed with my acting than he was with the assortment of treats at craft services,” Campbell joked. “But to be fair I get that a lot.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As the Wedding Every Weekend actor has grown as a parent, <a href=#>he has found a home with Hallmark Media</a>. In 2020, the Christmas by Starlight actor began writing for the network and in 2022 he cowrote Three Wise Men and a Baby with longtime friend, <a href=#><strong>Kimberley Sustad</strong></a>, which later became one of the biggest hits of the season.</p><p>“So much of the movie is these brothers acting like 13-year-olds and it really translates on and off camera,” Campbell <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in October 2022. “We just became, like, three 13-year-old friends and there happened to be a camera filming us while we did our job. It was really silly. And I will say without hesitation, I ruined the most takes because I couldn’t stop laughing.”</p><p>Scroll down to see how the Cases of Mystery Lane star’s goofball side translates to his fun life as husband to Metz and father to Kingston:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNktaK4y6aYq6NdqMGivoypmK6kXZiurrzBnqOlq12brq61y7JkmqSSqrpuvMeoq6irXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./howard-stern-joan-rivers-hooked-up-relationship.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Howard Stern Almost Hooked Up With Joan Rivers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./funny-face-biography-age-and-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Funny Face Biography Age And Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dwts-alum-milo-manheim-reveals-his-ideal-girl.html>'DWTS' Alum Milo Manheim Reveals His Ideal Girl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./15-of-the-thirstiest-celebs-on-instagram.html>15 Of The 'Thirstiest' Celebs On Instagram</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./simpsons-jokes-gags-cropped-aspect-ratio-html.html>16 Cropped Simpsons Jokes You Cant See on Disney+</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-oscar-monologues-and-opening-numbers-ranked-html.html>66 Oscar Monologues and Opening Numbers Ranked, From Worst to Best</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./workaholics-movie-canceled-paramount-plus-adam-devine-html.html>Adam DeVine Is Butt Hurt, and the Nation Weeps</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.

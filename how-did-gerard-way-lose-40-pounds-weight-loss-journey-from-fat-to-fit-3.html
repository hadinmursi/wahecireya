Still, we believe he indulged in the limited diet properly, for a specific duration, and he must have regularly exercised and worked out to reduce his body weight. Determination is an important key for any person to carry out any work; we believe the key to his success must have been his self-belief, hard work, and perseverance towards the work.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-supportive-are-the-family-of-gerard-way></span>How Supportive Are The Family Of Gerard Way?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gerard Way got into the music because of the support from his family and especially from his parents.</p><p>He is the son of Donna Lee and Donald Way, who were of Italian and Scottish descent, respectively, and from this, we can understand that he possesses a mixed ethnicity.
